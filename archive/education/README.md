## Overview

This educational series bridges ancient wisdom traditions with modern software practice. Each module can be studied independently or as part of the complete journey.

```clojure
(def learning-path
  {:foundations ["Nature of transformation"
                 "Sacred craftsmanship"
                 "Path of discipline"]
   :practices ["Community and contribution"
               "Dealing with failure"
               "Contemplative programming"]
   :advanced ["Code review as discipline"
              "Debugging as meditation"
              "Architecture as geometry"
              "Documentation as teaching"
              "Testing as prophecy"]})
```

## Module Structure

### Level 1: Foundations (01-foundations/)

Essential concepts that ground all practice:

1. **Transformation** — How change happens through code
2. **Craftsmanship** — Work as sacred service
3. **Discipline** — Constraints that liberate
4. **Community** — Strength through collaboration
5. **Failure** — Growth through difficulty
6. **Contemplation** — Code as meditation
7. **Vision** — Building for generations

### Level 2: Practices (02-practices/)

Daily rhythms and weekly cycles:

1. **Daily Practice** — Morning, midday, evening routines
2. **Weekly Rhythm** — Work and rest cycles
3. **Monthly Reflection** — Learning and growth review
4. **Yearly Milestones** — Long-term progress tracking

### Level 3: Advanced (03-advanced/)

Deep practices for experienced developers:

1. **Code Review** — Loving attention to others' work
2. **Debugging** — Investigation as meditation
3. **Architecture** — System design as sacred geometry
4. **Documentation** — Teaching as service
5. **Testing** — Prophetic declarations

## Wisdom Traditions Integrated

```clojure
(def wisdom-sources
  {:eastern {:chan "Wu wei, beginner's mind, presence"
             :taoism "Water's way, natural simplicity"
             :confucius "Five virtues, cultivation"
             :i-ching "Transformation, gradual progress"}
   :western {:hebrew "Sacred craft, sabbath, l'dor v'dor"
             :gospel "Rock foundation, talents, narrow path"
             :aristotle "Contemplation, virtue, eudaimonia"}})
```

## How to Use This Series

### For Beginners

Start with foundations in order:
1. Read 01-transformation.md
2. Study the Clojure examples
3. Apply one principle this week
4. Reflect on experience
5. Move to next module

### For Intermediate Developers

Focus on practices:
1. Choose one daily practice
2. Implement for 30 days
3. Document learnings
4. Share with team
5. Iterate and improve

### For Advanced Practitioners

Explore advanced modules:
1. Select one discipline (e.g., Code Review)
2. Study deeply for 90 days
3. Integrate with existing practice
4. Teach others
5. Contribute insights back

## Learning Principles

**Progressive Revelation** — Concepts build on each other, revealing deeper understanding over time.

**Experiential Learning** — Theory paired with practice, understanding through doing.

**Contemplative Approach** — Not just reading but reflecting, integrating, embodying.

**Community Practice** — Learn together, teach each other, grow collectively.

## Quick Reference

```clojure
(def quick-navigation
  {:need-motivation "Start with 01-foundations/01-transformation.md"
   :feeling-rushed "Read 01-foundations/03-discipline.md"
   :code-review-coming "Study 03-advanced/01-code-review.md"
   :stuck-on-bug "Review 03-advanced/02-debugging.md"
   :designing-system "See 03-advanced/03-architecture.md"
   :writing-docs "Check 03-advanced/04-documentation.md"
   :adding-tests "Read 03-advanced/05-testing.md"
   :daily-practice "Follow 02-practices/01-daily.md"})
```

---

## Module Completion Tracking

```clojure
(defn track-progress [completed-modules]
  {:foundations (count-in completed-modules :foundations)
   :practices (count-in completed-modules :practices)
   :advanced (count-in completed-modules :advanced)
   :total-progress (percentage-complete completed-modules)})
```

Mark completed modules in your own notes:
- [ ] 01-foundations/01-transformation.md
- [ ] 01-foundations/02-craftsmanship.md
- [ ] 01-foundations/03-discipline.md
- ... and so on
