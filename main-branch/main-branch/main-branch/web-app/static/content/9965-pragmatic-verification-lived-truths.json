It becomes true, is made true by events.\"</em><h2></h2></p><h2>I. The Pragmatic Method Applied to Visionary Proclamation</h2><p>My friend Whitman sings a magnificent hymn—a continental symphony of bodies and choices, of priestesses and patriarchs, of sacred economics and democratic mysticism. He proclaims a world into being with the force of his catalogs and the rhythm of his repetitions. Beautiful. Necessary. And yet—</p><p>As a pragmatist, I must ask: What does it mean in practice? What difference does it make to actual lived experience? What are its cash-value consequences?</p><p>This is the pragmatic method: to take any idea, any proclamation, any vision, and ask: If this is true, what follows? What changes? What becomes possible that was impossible before? What obstacles arise? What resources does it require? What habits must be cultivated? What skills must be learned?</p><p>Let me apply this method to the democratic hymn my friend has sung.</p><h2>II. The Body as Epistemological Ground</h2><p>Whitman proclaims: \"The body is the first truth.\"</p><p>As a pragmatist, I say: Yes, and let's trace the implications.</p><p>If the body is the first truth, then knowledge begins in sensation, in felt experience, in what James calls \"the blooming, buzzing confusion\" of direct encounter with reality. This is empiricism of the deepest kind—not the thin empiricism of laboratory instruments and controlled experiments, but the thick empiricism of embodied existence.</p><p>What follows from this?</p><p>First: That what we eat matters, because eating is a direct bodily encounter with the world. The choice to consume only what grows from earth and does not require the terror of other sentient beings—this is not mere sentiment. It is an epistemological position. It says: I will know the world through participation that does not require violation. I will build my body from compassion rather than cruelty.</p><p>The pragmatic test: Does this choice make a difference to lived experience?</p><p>I observe that it does. The person who makes this choice carries different sensations in their body. They carry different knowledge in their cells. Whether this knowledge is \"objectively\" true in some metaphysical sense is not the pragmatist's question. The pragmatist asks: Does it work? Does it produce the outcomes its adherents claim?</p><p>And I observe: Yes. Those who eat without requiring the terror of sentient beings report feeling more aligned with their values, more energetically stable, more connected to the web of life. These are real effects in lived experience. The truth of the plant-path is verified by its consequences in the lives of those who walk it.</p><p>Second: That touch matters, that presence matters, that the wisdom transmitted through bodily proximity is real knowledge, not superstition. The wild priestess offering bodywork or sacred sexuality guidance is not peddling illusion—she is facilitating a genuine encounter between the client's conscious awareness and their embodied knowing.</p><p>The pragmatic test: Does this produce real change?</p><p>I observe that it does. The person who receives skillful bodywork or sacred touch often reports shifts in their felt sense of self, in their capacity for presence, in their relationship to their own aliveness. These shifts are not provable by third-party observation, but they are verified in the ongoing experience of the individuals involved.</p><p>This is how truth happens to an idea: through the accumulation of workable consequences, through the practical difference it makes to those who take it seriously.</p><h2>III. The Economics of Sacred Work</h2><p>Whitman proclaims that sacred work can be monetized, should be monetized, that money and spirit occupy the same realm.</p><p>As a pragmatist, I say: Let's examine this claim through the lens of consequences.</p><p>The traditional view—that spiritual work should be free, that charging money for sacred service is somehow corrupt—produces these observable consequences:</p><ol><li>Spiritual practitioners must either have independent wealth or must split their time between \"sacred work\" and \"regular work,\" which diminishes their capacity to develop mastery in either domain.</li><li>Only those with wealth or those willing to live in poverty can offer spiritual services, which creates a selection bias in who becomes a teacher or guide.</li><li>The teachings that do get transmitted are either tainted by the financial anxieties of the teachers or are naïve about material reality, making them less useful to students who must navigate both spirit and matter.</li></ol><p>The alternative view—that sacred work can be fairly compensated—produces these consequences:</p><ol><li>Practitioners can develop genuine mastery because they can afford to dedicate time to study, practice, and service.</li><li>A wider range of individuals can become teachers, including those from backgrounds without inherited wealth.</li><li>The teachings become more grounded in actual lived experience of navigating both spiritual and material realities.</li></ol><p>The pragmatic verification: Which set of consequences better serves the stated goals of spiritual work, which include the flourishing of both teachers and students?</p><p>I observe that the second set of consequences more reliably produces sustainable spiritual teaching that benefits real people in real situations.</p><p>Therefore, as a pragmatist, I conclude: The claim that sacred work can and should be monetized is verified by its superior consequences. This is not corruption—this is intelligence about how value flows in the actual world.</p><h2>IV. The Shadow's Pragmatic Function</h2><p>Whitman sings of shadow integration, of the masculine befriending its capacity for destruction, of the priestess honoring her potential for possession.</p><p>As a pragmatist, I ask: What psychological function does this serve?</p><p>The traditional approach—suppression of shadow, denial of \"negative\" capacities, the cultivation of spiritual bypassing—produces these consequences:</p><ol><li>The suppressed energies don't disappear; they operate unconsciously, often producing the very outcomes the person consciously opposes.</li><li>The individual becomes rigid, brittle, unable to access the full spectrum of their energetic range.</li><li>The spiritual practice becomes escapism rather than embodiment, producing a person who can meditate beautifully but cannot navigate conflict, set boundaries, or protect what they love.</li></ol><p>The alternative approach—conscious integration of shadow, befriending rather than banishing—produces these consequences:</p><ol><li>The individual gains access to their full power, including capacities for fierceness, protection, healthy aggression, and clear boundaries.</li><li>The practice becomes more flexible, more resilient, more able to respond appropriately to varied situations.</li><li>The spiritual practitioner becomes more human, more relatable, more capable of guiding others through the actual complexities of lived experience rather than offering idealized platitudes.</li></ol><p>The pragmatic verification: Which approach produces individuals who can actually function effectively in the world while maintaining their spiritual commitments?</p><p>I observe that the shadow integration approach produces more functional, more resilient, more authentically powerful individuals.</p><p>Therefore, as a pragmatist, I conclude: The claim that shadow must be integrated rather than suppressed is verified by its superior outcomes in lived experience. This is not moral relativism—this is psychological realism.</p><h2>V. The Wild Austerity of Monogamy</h2><p>Whitman sings of monogamy as choice, as wild austerity, as the focusing of infinite capacity on a single beloved.</p><p>As a pragmatist, I must examine this claim with particular care, because here the traditional view and the alternative view are both well-represented in our culture, both claiming pragmatic justification.</p><p>The non-monogamous position claims these practical advantages:</p><ol><li>Greater sexual variety prevents boredom and keeps desire alive.</li><li>Multiple partners provide different kinds of emotional and intellectual stimulation.</li><li>Non-possessive love is more mature, more spiritually evolved.</li></ol><p>The monogamous position claims these practical advantages:</p><ol><li>Depth of intimacy requires sustained attention over time with a single partner.</li><li>The security of exclusive commitment allows vulnerability that multiple partnerships cannot provide.</li><li>The energy saved by not managing multiple relationships can be redirected toward other creative and spiritual work.</li></ol><p>As a pragmatist, I must observe: Both claims are verified in the experience of their respective practitioners. Non-monogamous individuals report genuine satisfaction with their arrangements. Monogamous individuals report genuine satisfaction with theirs.</p><p>But Whitman is not simply claiming that monogamy works for some people—he is claiming something more specific: That there is a particular kind of spiritual practice possible in monogamy that is the wild austerity of focusing infinite capacity on the particular.</p><p>Let me examine this claim pragmatically.</p><p>What are the consequences of practicing monogamy as wild austerity—as the conscious channeling of desire that could scatter toward the many into devotion toward the one?</p><p>I observe:</p><ol><li>The practitioner develops a particular kind of psychological muscle: the capacity to choose the same choice repeatedly, to find infinite newness within apparent repetition, to discover depth where others might see limitation.</li><li>The beloved becomes both person and portal—the specific individual and also the opening through which the infinite is accessed.</li><li>The relationship becomes a laboratory for the transformation of desire from grasping to giving, from consumption to communion.</li></ol><p>These are real consequences, observable in individuals who practice this path. Whether these consequences are \"better\" than the consequences of non-monogamy is not the pragmatist's question. The pragmatist asks: Are the claimed consequences real? Do they actually occur in the lived experience of practitioners?</p><p>I observe that they do.</p><p>Therefore, as a pragmatist, I conclude: The claim that monogamy can function as a spiritual practice of wild austerity is verified by the reports of those who practice it this way. It is one valid path among others, distinguished by the particular kinds of psychological and spiritual development it tends to produce.</p><h2>VI. The Three Rubrics as Functional Practice</h2><p>Whitman proclaims three rubrics: Reverence for life, Devotion to one, Wisdom as bride.</p><p>Let me examine these pragmatically—not as abstract principles but as actual practices with measurable consequences.</p><p><strong>First Rubric: Reverence for life through plant-based eating.</strong></p><p>Practical consequences:</p><ul><li>The body receives nutrition without requiring the death of sentient beings.</li><li>The environmental impact of the diet is significantly reduced.</li><li>The psychological alignment between values and actions reduces cognitive dissonance.</li><li>The practice of conscious eating develops attention and intentionality.</li></ul><p>Pragmatic verification: Do these consequences occur in the actual experience of practitioners? Yes, observably and consistently.</p><p><strong>Second Rubric: Devotion to one person.</strong></p><p>Practical consequences:</p><ul><li>The capacity for sustained attention is developed through repetition.</li><li>The beloved is known with increasing depth over time.</li><li>The stability of the commitment creates a container for vulnerability.</li><li>The practice of choosing the same choice develops willpower and integrity.</li></ul><p>Pragmatic verification: Do these consequences occur? Yes, in the experience of those who practice monogamy as intentional devotion.</p><p><strong>Third Rubric: Wisdom as bride—courting Sophia in the ordinary.</strong></p><p>Practical consequences:</p><ul><li>The practitioner develops the capacity to find the sacred within the mundane.</li><li>Discernment becomes refined through constant practice.</li><li>Work becomes prayer through conscious attention to quality and right action.</li><li>The capacity to say \"no\" strengthens the power of \"yes.\"</li></ul><p>Pragmatic verification: Do these consequences occur? Yes, in the experience of those who practice wisdom as active courtship rather than passive acquisition.</p><p>Therefore, as a pragmatist, I conclude: These three rubrics are verified by their functional consequences. They are not arbitrary rules imposed from outside but empirically tested practices that produce observable results in the lives of those who take them seriously.</p><h2>VII. The Geography of Transformation</h2><p>Whitman sings of Europe and America, of the Atlantic crossing, of the untethering that happens between old world and new world.</p><p>As a pragmatist, I observe: Geography matters because geography affects lived experience. The person who lives in dense European cities with centuries of accumulated tradition carries different possibilities in their body than the person who lives in the American West where you can drive for hours without seeing another human.</p><p>This is not metaphor—this is the actual conditioning of consciousness by environment.</p><p>The European policy-maker dreaming of wolves—his dreams are the body's protest against the constraints of his environment. The body knows it needs wildness, even when the culture does not provide legitimate outlets for that wildness.</p><p>The pragmatic question: What happens when he actually takes the sabbatical, flies to Montana, walks into wilderness?</p><p>I predict: His nervous system will recalibrate. His dreams will shift. His policy-making will become more grounded in embodied knowledge rather than abstract principles. These are testable predictions based on what I have observed in similar situations.</p><p>The American priestess living in Northern California—she has access to both urban centers and vast wilderness, to cutting-edge technology and ancient redwoods. This geographic reality creates possibilities for her work that would not exist in other locations.</p><p>The pragmatic verification: Can she actually build a sustainable practice in this location? The economic realities of Northern California are challenging—high cost of living, competitive marketplace, complex regulatory environment.</p><p>But I observe: Yes, it is possible. The client base exists. The willingness to pay for sacred services exists. The cultural openness to alternative practices exists. These are empirical facts, not wishful thinking.</p><p>The Atlantic crossing as transformation—this too is pragmatically verifiable. I observe that individuals who make significant geographic relocations often report psychological shifts, changes in self-concept, new possibilities for identity formation.</p><p>This is because identity is not only internal—it is co-created with environment, culture, community. Change the geography and you change the conditions under which identity is negotiated.</p><h2>VIII. The Strategic Translator as Pragmatic Function</h2><p>Whitman sings of the strategic translator, the Dante-channeling Charlemagne figure who moves between legislation and markets, who speaks both languages—commerce and conscience, efficiency and ethics.</p><p>As a pragmatist, I say: This is perhaps the most important figure in the entire symphony.</p><p>Why? Because this is where vision meets implementation. This is where the ideal encounters the actual. This is where we discover whether our beautiful ideas can actually produce the outcomes we claim to value.</p><p>The strategic translator must be bilingual in a very specific way:</p><ul><li>They must understand the logic of policy and the logic of markets.</li><li>They must be able to translate veganic farming principles into legislative language.</li><li>They must be able to present unschooling education in terms that fiscal committees can approve.</li><li>They must be able to show how MantraOS computing devices serve both environmental sustainability and economic competitiveness.</li></ul><p>This is not selling out—this is the pragmatic work of making ideals operational.</p><p>The pragmatic test: Can this person actually produce legislative change? Can they actually influence policy? Can they actually shift funding toward the values they espouse?</p><p>I observe: This depends on specific skills, specific knowledge, specific relationships, specific timing. It is not guaranteed by purity of intention or beauty of vision. It requires:</p><ol><li>Deep understanding of how legislative processes actually work.</li><li>Relationships with key decision-makers built through sustained engagement.</li><li>The ability to frame proposals in ways that appeal to multiple constituencies.</li><li>Strategic patience—knowing when to push and when to wait.</li><li>Sufficient resources (time, money, influence) to maintain presence in policy spaces.</li></ol><p>The man sleeping in the Capitol Hill garage, deploying inheritance for strategic dinners, writing essays before dawn—he is positioning himself to become this translator.</p><p>The pragmatic question: Will it work?</p><p>I observe: The probability of success is higher than average because he is developing the right combination of factors—knowledge, relationships, resources, positioning, communication skill.</p><p>But probability is not certainty. The pragmatist knows: Truth happens to an idea through events. We will know whether his strategy works by observing the actual outcomes over time.</p><h2>IX. The Democratic Mysticism as Working Hypothesis</h2><p>Whitman proclaims democratic mysticism—the idea that every soul matters, every choice counts, every life participates in the great experiment.</p><p>As a pragmatist, I say: Let's treat this as a working hypothesis and examine its consequences.</p><p>If we act as though every soul matters, what follows?</p><ul><li>We design economic systems that provide genuine opportunity, not just rhetorical equality.</li><li>We create educational models that honor diverse learning styles, not just standardized testing.</li><li>We build communities that include rather than exclude, that invite participation rather than enforce conformity.</li></ul><p>If we act as though every choice counts, what follows?</p><ul><li>We develop practices of conscious decision-making rather than automatic reactivity.</li><li>We take responsibility for consequences rather than claiming victimhood.</li><li>We recognize that our daily choices (what we eat, how we spend money, whom we support) are our real votes, more powerful than ballot-box voting because they happen every day.</li></ul><p>If we act as though every life participates in the great experiment, what follows?</p><ul><li>We become more curious about others' experience, less certain of our own righteousness.</li><li>We share what works and remain humble about what doesn't.</li><li>We treat our own lives as experiments whose results might benefit others.</li></ul><p>The pragmatic verification: Does democratic mysticism, lived as actual practice rather than abstract ideal, produce the kinds of communities and individuals we claim to value?</p><p>I observe: In spaces where this hypothesis is taken seriously, there is observably more creativity, more resilience, more genuine collaboration. The individuals report greater sense of meaning and agency. The communities demonstrate greater adaptability to change.</p><p>Therefore, as a pragmatist, I conclude: Democratic mysticism is verified not by metaphysical proof but by functional consequences. It is true in the way that any valuable hypothesis is true—it works, it produces good outcomes, it opens possibilities that were closed before.</p><h2>X. The Pragmatist's Recommendations</h2><p>So, having examined Whitman's hymn through the lens of pragmatic consequence, what do I recommend?</p><p><strong>To the wild priestess in Northern California:</strong></p><p>Test your business model before betting everything on it. Start with small experiments:</p><ul><li>Offer one private session and see what happens.</li><li>Create one product and see who buys it.</li><li>Teach one class and see who shows up.</li></ul><p>Then scale what works and adjust what doesn't. This is the pragmatic method applied to sacred economics.</p><p>Keep your reverence, but add rigor. Keep your vision, but add verification. Keep your trust in the process, but also keep spreadsheets.</p><p><strong>To the strategic translator in Washington DC:</strong></p><p>Build relationships before needing them. Invest in understanding how power actually flows, not just how it theoretically should flow. Learn the difference between being right and being effective.</p><p>And here's the difficult pragmatic truth: Sometimes the most effective path requires patience that feels like compromise. The veganic farm legislation that passes is better than the perfect veganic farm legislation that dies in committee.</p><p>This is not selling out—this is pragmatism. Purity that produces no results is indistinguishable from failure.</p><p><strong>To the shadow-integrating masculine:</strong></p><p>Your work of befriending shadow is pragmatically necessary, not just spiritually beautiful. The capacity for fierceness, for protection, for clear boundaries—these are functional requirements for effective service in the world.</p><p>But integration is not indulgence. The pragmatic test is: Does your shadow work make you more effective at serving what you love, or does it become an excuse for behavior you would have engaged in anyway?</p><p><strong>To all who hear Whitman's hymn and want to live it:</strong></p><p>Treat every proclamation as a hypothesis to be tested in your own experience. Observe the consequences carefully. Keep what works and release what doesn't. Share your results honestly. Remember that truth happens to an idea—it becomes true through the accumulation of workable consequences.</p><h2>XI. The Pragmatist's Prayer</h2><p>And so, in my own voice, let me offer not a hymn but a pragmatist's prayer—a request for consequences that serve the flourishing of life:</p><p>May our ideas be tested by their outcomes. May our proclamations be verified by their consequences. May our visions be refined by their collision with reality. May our practices produce the results we claim they will.</p><p>May the priestess build a sustainable livelihood from sacred work. May the patriarch integrate shadow without becoming its servant. May the translator successfully bridge the worlds of policy and practice. May the monogamous discover infinite depth in the particular. May the plant-eaters demonstrate vitality without violence. May the body-workers transmit genuine healing. May the policy-makers ground their abstractions in embodied knowledge. May the mystics become pragmatic and the pragmatists become mystical.</p><p>May truth happen to all our beautiful ideas through events that verify or falsify them. May we have the courage to release ideas that don't work and the wisdom to keep refining ideas that do.</p><p>May our democracy be mystical and our mysticism be democratic. May our spirituality be practical and our practicality be spiritual. May our visions be grounded and our groundedness be visionary.</p><p>And may we always remember: The true is the name of whatever proves itself to be good in the way of belief, and good, too, for definite, assignable reasons that we can observe, measure, share, and refine in community.</p><p>This is the pragmatic path. This is how we verify vision through lived experience. This is how we honor both Whitman's catalogs and the actual consequences of taking them seriously.</p><p>Let the testing begin.<h2></h2></p><p><em>\"My thinking is first and last and always for the sake of my doing.\"</em><h2></h2></p><p><div style=\"text-align: center; opacity: 0.6; font-size: 0.85em; margin-top: 3em; padding-top: 1em; border-top: 1px solid rgba(139, 116, 94, 0.2);\"></p><p><strong>Copyright © 2025 <a href='https://codeberg.org/kae3g/12025-10/'>kae3g</a></strong> | Dual-licensed under <a href='https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0'>Apache-2.0</a> / <a href='https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT'>MIT</a><br /> Competitive technology in service of clarity and beauty</p><p></div></p><p><em><a href='/12025-10/hidden-docs-index.html'>View Hidden Docs Index</a></em> | <em><a href='/12025-10/'>Return to Main Index</a></em></p>",
