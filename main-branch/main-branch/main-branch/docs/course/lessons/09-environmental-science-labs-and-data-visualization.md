## üåä Introduction

Welcome to Session 9! Today we're exploring how Grain Network principles apply to environmental science and engineering labs. Inspired by the **Ecohydraulics and Ecomorphodynamics Laboratory (EEL) at UIUC**, we'll design software for field data collection, analysis, and visualization with immutable data trails.

### Why Environmental Labs Need Grain Network

**The Challenge**: Environmental field studies generate massive amounts of data (water quality, flow rates, temperature, biological samples) that must be:
- **Immutably recorded** - measurements can't be changed retroactively
- **Precisely timestamped** - when and where matters
- **Globally shareable** - labs worldwide benefit from shared data
- **Visually accessible** - stakeholders need intuitive visualizations

**The Solution**: Grain Network's immutable grainpath system, neovedic timestamps, and decentralized storage.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:

1. **Understand** how environmental data requires immutability and precision
2. **Design** data collection systems for field studies
3. **Implement** visualization tools using Clojure Humble UI
4. **Apply** grainpath versioning to scientific datasets
5. **Create** decentralized collaboration networks for environmental research

## üìä Part 1: Environmental Data Collection (30 minutes)

### The EEL Lab Example

The **Ecohydraulics and Ecomorphodynamics Laboratory** studies:
- **Stream ecology**: How water flow affects ecosystems
- **Dye tracer studies**: Tracking water movement (bright green dye in streams!)
- **Geomorphology**: How rivers shape landscapes
- **Habitat restoration**: Improving conditions for aquatic life

**Field Data Types**:
```clojure
{:field-measurement
 {:graintime "12025-10-22--1430--CDT--moon-uttara-ashadha--06thhouse14--eel-lab"
  :location
  {:name "Embarras River, IL"
   :latitude 39.7817
   :longitude -88.2034
   :elevation-m 220.5}
  
  :water-quality
  {:temperature-c 18.5
   :ph 7.2
   :dissolved-oxygen-mg-l 8.4
   :turbidity-ntu 12.3
   :conductivity-us-cm 425}
  
  :flow-data
  {:velocity-m-s 0.85
   :depth-m 1.2
   :discharge-m3-s 4.5
   :cross-section-area-m2 5.3}
  
  :dye-tracer
  {:injection-time "14:00:00"
   :detection-time "14:15:00"
   :concentration-ppb 45.2
   :tracer-type "Rhodamine WT"}
  
  :biological
  {:species-count 12
   :dominant-species "Catostomus commersonii"  ; White sucker
   :habitat-quality-score 7.8}
  
  :metadata
  {:collector "kae3g"
   :equipment ["YSI ProDSS" "FlowTracker2" "Turner Cyclops-7F"]
   :weather "Partly cloudy, 22¬∞C, wind 8 km/h SE"
   :grainpath "/field-data/embarras-river/2025-10-22/study-01/12025-10-22--1430--CDT--moon-uttara-ashadha--06thhouse14--eel-lab/"}}}
```

**Why This Design?**:
- **Graintime timestamp**: Exact moment of measurement with astronomical context
- **Grainpath**: Immutable path for permanent record
- **Structured data**: Easy to query, analyze, visualize
- **Equipment metadata**: Reproducibility and calibration tracking

4. **Forest Canopy Analysis** (biodiversity study)

**Requirements**:
- Graintime timestamp
- Location coordinates
- At least 5 measurements
- Equipment metadata
- Grainpath for immutability

## üó∫Ô∏è Part 2: Data Visualization Systems (30 minutes)

### Graingource: Git Visualization for Environmental Data

**Inspired by Gource** (Git repository visualizer), **Graingource** visualizes environmental data streams in real-time:

**Features**:
- **Spatial mapping**: Plot measurement locations on maps
- **Temporal animation**: Watch data evolve over time
- **Multi-variable display**: Temperature, pH, flow rate simultaneously
- **Immutable playback**: Replay any study from grainpath archives

**Architecture**:
```
Field Sensors ‚Üí Grain Network ‚Üí Graingource Visualizer
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
 Data points   Immutable      Interactive maps
 (real-time)   grainpaths     (web + desktop)
```

### Implementation: Clojure Humble UI

**Graingource Core**:
```clojure
(ns graingource.core
  "Environmental data visualization inspired by Gource"
  (:require [io.github.humbleui.core :as ui]
            [io.github.humbleui.paint :as paint]
            [io.github.humbleui.canvas :as canvas]))

(defn render-measurement-point
  "Render a single data point on the map"
  [measurement]
  (let [lat (:latitude (:location measurement))
        lon (:longitude (:location measurement))
        value (:temperature-c (:water-quality measurement))
        ;; Convert lat/lon to screen coordinates
        x (lon-to-x lon)
        y (lat-to-y lat)
        ;; Color based on temperature (blue=cold, red=hot)
        color (temperature-to-color value)]
    (canvas/draw-circle canvas x y 5 (paint/fill color))))

(defn render-stream-flow
  "Visualize water flow direction and velocity"
  [flow-data]
  (let [velocity (:velocity-m-s flow-data)
        direction (:bearing flow-data)
        ;; Arrow length proportional to velocity
        arrow-length (* velocity 10)
        ;; Arrow points in flow direction
        end-x (+ x (* arrow-length (Math/cos direction)))
        end-y (+ y (* arrow-length (Math/sin direction)))]
    (canvas/draw-line canvas x y end-x end-y
                     (paint/stroke (paint/color 0x0000FF) 2))))

(defn render-dye-tracer
  "Animate dye tracer dispersion over time"
  [tracer-data time-offset]
  (let [injection-time (:injection-time tracer-data)
        current-time (+ injection-time time-offset)
        ;; Dye spreads as Gaussian plume
        concentration (gaussian-dispersion
                       (:x tracer-data)
                       current-time
                       (:velocity tracer-data)
                       (:dispersion-coefficient tracer-data))
        ;; Bright green for visibility!
        opacity (min 1.0 (/ concentration 100))
        color (paint/color 0x00FF00 opacity)]
    (canvas/draw-circle canvas x y 20 (paint/fill color))))

(defn graingource-app
  "Main application window"
  []
  (ui/default-theme
    (ui/column
      (ui/label "Graingource - Environmental Data Visualization")
      (ui/row
        (ui/button "Play" #(start-animation))
        (ui/button "Pause" #(pause-animation))
        (ui/slider 0 100 50 #(set-playback-speed %)))
      (ui/canvas
        {:on-paint render-all-measurements}))))
```

**Web Deployment**: Via **ClojureScript + SVG** for browser compatibility

1. **Water Temperature Heatmap** - River temperature across 24 hours
2. **Dye Tracer Animation** - How dye spreads downstream
3. **Species Distribution Map** - Where different fish species live
4. **Flow Velocity Vectors** - Water movement arrows

**Requirements**:
- X and Y axes labeled
- Color legend
- Time slider (for animations)
- Data source (grainpath)

## üî¨ Part 3: Immutable Data Trails (20 minutes)

### Why Immutability Matters in Science

**The Problem**: Traditional scientific data management
```
1. Collect data ‚Üí Excel spreadsheet
2. "Oops, typo!" ‚Üí Edit cell
3. "Which version is correct?" ‚Üí Lost history
4. Peer review ‚Üí "Can't reproduce your results"
```

**The Grain Solution**: Immutable grainpaths
```
1. Collect data ‚Üí Grainpath with graintime timestamp
2. "Oops, typo!" ‚Üí New grainpath with correction + reference to original
3. "Which version is correct?" ‚Üí Complete audit trail
4. Peer review ‚Üí Exact reproduction via grainpath
```

**Example: Data Correction Workflow**:
```clojure
;; Original measurement (with error)
{:grainpath "/field-data/embarras/2025-10-22/v1/12025-10-22--1430--CDT/"
 :temperature-c 185.5  ; ERROR! Should be 18.5
 :status :superceded
 :superceded-by "/field-data/embarras/2025-10-22/v2/12025-10-22--1445--CDT/"}

;; Corrected measurement (new grainpath)
{:grainpath "/field-data/embarras/2025-10-22/v2/12025-10-22--1445--CDT/"
 :temperature-c 18.5   ; CORRECTED
 :correction-note "Original temperature was decimal point error"
 :supercedes "/field-data/embarras/2025-10-22/v1/12025-10-22--1430--CDT/"
 :status :active}
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Complete history**: Every version preserved
- ‚úÖ **Transparent corrections**: Clear audit trail
- ‚úÖ **Reproducible science**: Exact data for peer review
- ‚úÖ **Legal compliance**: Environmental regulations require data integrity

### Case Study: UIUC EEL Lab Bright Green Stream

**The Study**: Students inject bright green dye into a stream to study water flow patterns.

**Data Pipeline**:
```
1. Injection
   Grainpath: /eel-lab/dye-tracer/injection/12025-04-15--0900--CDT/
   Data: {location, time, dye-mass-kg, injection-rate}

2. Observation Points (every 100m downstream)
   Grainpath: /eel-lab/dye-tracer/observation/site-01/12025-04-15--0915--CDT/
   Data: {concentration-ppb, detection-time, photo-url}

3. Analysis
   Grainpath: /eel-lab/dye-tracer/analysis/v1/12025-04-16--1200--CDT/
   Data: {velocity-m-s, dispersion-coefficient, mixing-depth}

4. Publication
   Grainpath: /eel-lab/publications/2025-Q2-stream-mixing/12025-06-01--1000--CDT/
   References: All observation grainpaths (immutable citations!)
```

**Result**: Entire study reproducible from grainpaths. Future students can:
- View original field photos
- Rerun analysis with updated models
- Compare with other streams globally

## üåê Part 4: Decentralized Collaboration (20 minutes)

### Grain Network for Global Environmental Research

**The Vision**: Environmental labs worldwide share data via Grain Network:

**Example Network**:
```
UIUC EEL Lab (Illinois) ‚Üê‚Üí Grain Network ‚Üê‚Üí TU Delft (Netherlands)
        ‚Üì                                           ‚Üì
  Embarras River data                     Rhine River data
        ‚Üì                                           ‚Üì
    Compare stream ecology across continents!
```

**Implementation**: ICP + Hedera + Grainpath

```clojure
(ns grain-environmental.network
  "Decentralized environmental data sharing")

(defn publish-field-data
  "Publish environmental data to Grain Network"
  [measurement]
  (let [graintime (gt/now (:collector measurement))
        grainpath (generate-grainpath "field-data" graintime)
        ;; Store on ICP for permanent, decentralized hosting
        icp-canister-id (icp/store-data measurement)
        ;; Record on Hedera for consensus timestamp
        hedera-tx-id (hedera/submit-hash (hash measurement))
        ;; Create Grainclay beam for network distribution
        beam {:grainpath grainpath
              :icp-canister icp-canister-id
              :hedera-consensus hedera-tx-id
              :public true
              :license "CC-BY-4.0"}]
    (grainclay/publish beam)
    grainpath))

(defn query-global-data
  "Query environmental data across all participating labs"
  [filters]
  (let [;; Search across ICP canisters
        results (icp/query-canisters
                 {:parameter (:parameter filters)
                  :location (:region filters)
                  :time-range (:dates filters)})
        ;; Verify data integrity via Hedera
        verified (map verify-hedera-hash results)]
    verified))
```

**Use Cases**:

1. **Climate Change Monitoring**
   - Global temperature database
   - Every lab contributes local measurements
   - Grainpaths ensure data provenance

2. **Species Migration Tracking**
   - Multiple labs observe same species
   - Immutable timestamps prove observation times
   - Create continental migration maps

3. **Water Quality Networks**
   - River systems span countries
   - Upstream/downstream collaboration
   - Pollution source identification

### Activity: Design a Collaboration Network (15 minutes)

## üåç Part 6: Social Impact and Ethics (15 minutes)

### Environmental Justice

**The Problem**: Environmental data is often:
- Locked behind paywalls
- Owned by governments/corporations
- Inaccessible to affected communities
- Delayed or censored

**The Grain Solution**:
- **Open Access**: All data public by default
- **Community Ownership**: Local communities host their own data
- **Real-Time Transparency**: Immediate publication
- **Immutable Records**: Can't be censored or altered

**Example: Community Water Monitoring**
```
Flint, Michigan (2014-2015)
Problem: Government claimed water was safe, but residents knew it wasn't
Grain Solution: Community-owned sensors ‚Üí Real-time grainpaths ‚Üí Immutable proof
Result: No one can deny the evidence
```

### Case Studies

**1. Indigenous Environmental Monitoring**
- **Challenge**: Traditional knowledge + scientific data
- **Solution**: Grainpath metadata includes both
- **Impact**: Indigenous communities control their data

**2. Citizen Science Networks**
- **Challenge**: Non-experts collecting data
- **Solution**: Grainpath validates equipment + protocols
- **Impact**: Democratized environmental research

**3. Climate Refugee Documentation**
- **Challenge**: Proving displacement due to environment
- **Solution**: Immutable grainpaths show environmental changes over time
- **Impact**: Legal evidence for asylum claims

### Discussion Questions (10 minutes)

1. **Who should own environmental data?** Government? Universities? Communities? Everyone?

2. **Should data ever be kept private?** What about endangered species locations?

3. **How do we handle data quality?** Not all sensors are equally accurate.

4. **What about developing countries?** How do we ensure equitable access to Grain Network?

5. **Can immutable data be dangerous?** What if it reveals sensitive information?

## üß™ Hands-On Project: Build a Grainfield Prototype (30 minutes)

### Project: Simple Water Quality Monitor

**Goal**: Create a basic field data collection tool that generates grainpaths.

**Requirements**:
- Collects 3+ measurements (temperature, pH, conductivity)
- Records GPS coordinates
- Generates graintime timestamp
- Saves to EDN file with grainpath
- Displays data in simple visualization

**Starter Code**:
```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env bb

(require '[babashka.process :refer [shell]]
         '[clojure.string :as str]
         '[clojure.java.io :as io])

(defn get-gps-coordinates []
  "Get current GPS coordinates (placeholder - use real GPS device)"
  {:latitude 39.7817
   :longitude -88.2034
   :elevation-m 220.5})

(defn collect-measurement []
  "Collect environmental measurements"
  (println "=== Grainfield Water Quality Monitor ===")
  (println "")
  (print "Water temperature (¬∞C): ")
  (flush)
  (let [temp (read-line)
        _ (print "pH: ")
        _ (flush)
        ph (read-line)
        _ (print "Conductivity (ŒºS/cm): ")
        _ (flush)
        conductivity (read-line)
        ;; Generate graintime
        author "grainfield"
        graintime (-> (shell {:out :string} "gt" "now" author)
                     :out
                     str/trim)
        ;; Get location
        location (get-gps-coordinates)
        ;; Create grainpath
        grainpath (str "/field-data/water-quality/" graintime "/")]
    {:field-measurement
     {:graintime graintime
      :grainpath grainpath
      :location location
      :water-quality
      {:temperature-c (Double/parseDouble temp)
       :ph (Double/parseDouble ph)
       :conductivity-us-cm (Double/parseDouble conductivity)}
      :metadata
      {:collector author
       :equipment ["Grainfield v1.0"]
       :created graintime}}}))

(defn save-measurement [measurement]
  "Save measurement to EDN file"
  (let [filename (str "measurement-" (:graintime (:field-measurement measurement)) ".edn")]
    (spit filename (pr-str measurement))
    (println "")
    (println "‚úÖ Measurement saved to:" filename)
    (println "üìç Grainpath:" (:grainpath (:field-measurement measurement)))))

(defn main []
  (let [measurement (collect-measurement)]
    (save-measurement measurement)))

(main)
```

**Run It**:
```bash
chmod +x grainfield.bb
./grainfield.bb
```

**Extension Challenges**:
1. Add more measurement types (dissolved oxygen, turbidity)
2. Validate input ranges (pH must be 0-14)
3. Generate simple ASCII visualization
4. Upload to ICP canister
5. Create map visualization of multiple measurements

## üåü Closing Reflection

Today we learned how Grain Network principles (immutability, precision timestamps, decentralized collaboration) apply to environmental science. The same technology that powers Grainmusic and Graincourse can:

- **Preserve** irreplaceable environmental data
- **Empower** communities to monitor their own environments
- **Enable** global scientific collaboration
- **Ensure** transparency and accountability

**Remember**: Every grainpath is permanent. Every measurement matters. Every student can contribute to understanding and protecting our planet.

**The bright green dye in that stream?** It's teaching us how water moves, how ecosystems connect, how we can design better river restoration. And with Grain Network, that knowledge becomes permanent, shareable, and accessible to everyone.
