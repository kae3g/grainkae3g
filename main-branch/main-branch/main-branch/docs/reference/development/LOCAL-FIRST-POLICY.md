# Local-First Data Policy

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-11 (Session 7737)  
**Scope**: Pollen Mobile infrastructure, tundra IoT devices, community-owned systems  
**Philosophy**: Data sovereignty through implosive architectures

---

## Principle

**Default to local. Escalate only when necessary. Never because it's convenient.**

Traditional systems **explode** data outward—everything goes to the cloud, centralized servers, corporate databases. Value and knowledge extracted. Surveillance built-in. Trust assumed.

Our systems **implode** data inward—everything stays local by default, escalates only when needed, remains under community control. Value retained. Privacy inherent. Trust verified.

This is Schauberger's implosion principle applied to information architecture.

## Core Rules

### Rule 1: Store Locally First

**All data begins on the device that generates it.**

- Sensor readings stay on the sensor
- User preferences stay on the user's device
- Logs stay on the server that generated them
- Photos stay on the camera's storage
- Messages stay on sender/receiver devices

**Rationale**: Locality minimizes attack surface, respects privacy, enables offline function, reduces dependencies.

### Rule 2: Process Locally When Possible

**Computation happens near the data.**

- Aggregation on edge devices before any transmission
- Anonymization at collection point, not after transmission
- Filtering and summarization before network transit
- Heavy processing on community servers, not distant clouds

**Rationale**: Less data movement = less energy, less exposure, less latency, more sovereignty.

### Rule 3: Sync Only What's Necessary

**Network traffic is purposeful, not automatic.**

- Explicit sync triggers (user action, scheduled backup, manual export)
- Compressed, deduplicated transfers
- Batch operations during low-cost windows (night, off-peak)
- Resume-able transfers (network interruption = pause, not failure)

**Rationale**: Bandwidth is finite, energy has costs, connectivity isn't guaranteed, efficiency matters.

### Rule 4: Retain Control of Copies

**When data leaves the local environment, control follows.**

- Encryption before transmission (no plaintext in transit)
- Recipient verification (who/what receives, why, for how long)
- Deletion capability (ability to revoke remote copies)
- Audit trails (log who accessed what, when, why)

**Rationale**: Sovereignty means control over your data's entire lifecycle, not just initial collection.

### Rule 5: Document Escalation

**Every non-local operation is documented and justified.**

- Why data must leave local network
- What specific data is transmitted
- Where it goes (recipient, geographic location)
- When it's transmitted (real-time, batched, manual)
- How long it's retained remotely
- Who can access it there

**Rationale**: Transparency enables accountability, trust requires verification, documentation protects everyone.

## Application to Pollen Infrastructure

### Pollen Flower Radios

**Data Generated**:
- Connected device counts (per hour)
- Signal strength measurements (RSSI, RSRP, SINR)
- Bandwidth usage (upload/download by hour)
- Uptime statistics (service availability)
- Coverage verification proofs (for PollenCoin rewards)

**Local Storage**:
- 30 days of raw logs on the Flower's internal storage
- Aggregated hourly stats for 1 year
- Daily backups to deployer's local server (if configured)

**What Escalates**:
- **To Pollen Network**: Proof-of-coverage claims (hourly) for token rewards
  - Includes: Location (GPS), device count (anonymized), signal strength (aggregate)
  - Excludes: Individual device IDs, traffic content, user identities
- **To Solana Blockchain**: Coverage proofs and payment transactions (public ledger)
  - Includes: Coverage validation, token transfers, deployer addresses
  - Excludes: Detailed usage data, specific devices, traffic patterns

**What Never Escalates**:
- Packet contents (encrypted end-to-end, Flower never decrypts)
- Individual device identifiers (MAC addresses, IMEI)
- User location tracking (connection ≠ surveillance)
- Traffic analysis (who talks to whom, when, for how long)

### tundra IoT Devices (Hummingbirds)

**Example: Weather Station at Repair Cafe**

**Data Generated**:
- Temperature, humidity, air quality (PM2.5, PM10, CO2)
- Readings every 5 minutes
- Timestamps, sensor calibration metadata

**Local Storage**:
- 7 days of raw readings on device (SD card)
- Last 24 hours in RAM (rolling buffer)
- Display shows current + 24h graph (local LCD screen)

**What Escalates**:
- **To Repair Cafe Server** (via Pollen Flower): Hourly averages
  - Transmitted: Aggregated data (mean, min, max, stddev per hour)
  - Not transmitted: Minute-by-minute fluctuations
- **To Community Dashboard** (public website): Daily summaries
  - Transmitted: Daily aggregates + historical trends (anonymized location)
  - Not transmitted: Real-time data, precise device location, high-resolution time-series

**What Never Escalates**:
- Individual readings (unless specifically requested for debugging)
- Calibration secrets (algorithms, offsets, sensor-specific tuning)
- Device identifiers (MAC, serial numbers)

**Justification for Escalation**:
- Community awareness (local air quality trends)
- Research data (climate monitoring, health studies)
- Grant applications (demonstrate community infrastructure)
- Public good (Open data for all, not proprietary hoarding)

## Privacy Protections

### Anonymization at the Edge

**Before any data leaves the local device:**

1. **Aggregation** - Reduce resolution (minute → hour → day)
2. **Noise injection** - Differential privacy where applicable
3. **Identifier removal** - Strip MAC addresses, IPs, device IDs
4. **Hashing** - Replace reversible IDs with one-way hashes (when IDs needed)

**Example**: Pollen Flower reports "42 devices connected in hour 14:00-15:00" not "Device A (MAC XX:XX:...) connected at 14:23:17, Device B at 14:31:02..."

### Encryption Everywhere

**All network transmission uses:**

- **TLS 1.3+** for HTTPS connections
- **WireGuard or IPsec** for VPN tunnels (when needed)
- **End-to-end encryption** for messaging (Signal protocol or similar)
- **Certificate pinning** to prevent MITM attacks

**At rest, encryption for:**

- Full-disk encryption on all storage devices
- Database encryption for sensitive tables
- Encrypted backups (never store plaintext remotely)

### Access Control

**Who can read what:**

- **Device owner**: Full access to local data
- **Community admins**: Aggregated statistics only
- **Public**: Anonymized, aggregated, delayed public data sets
- **Researchers**: Anonymized data with explicit community consent
- **Law enforcement**: Only with warrant, documented publicly post-resolution

**Implementation**:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logs for all access (who, what, when, why)
- Automatic log review (flag unusual access patterns)
- Community review (quarterly transparency reports)

---

## Data Retention

### On-Device

- **Raw sensor data**: 7-30 days (configurable by deployer)
- **Aggregated stats**: 1-5 years (depends on storage capacity)
- **Logs**: 30-90 days (security, debugging)
- **Backups**: Managed by deployer (recommend 3-2-1 rule)

### On Community Servers

- **Aggregated data**: Indefinite (for historical trends)
- **Raw logs**: 90 days (then delete or archive offline)
- **User accounts**: Active + 1 year inactivity (then delete)
- **Audit trails**: 7 years (legal/accountability)

### On Blockchain

- **Coverage proofs**: Permanent (part of consensus)
- **Transactions**: Permanent (public ledger)
- **No PII**: Design ensures no personal info ever hits chain

### Deletion Requests

**User rights**:
- Request all data about you (within 30 days)
- Request deletion of all data (within 60 days, except legal holds)
- Opt-out of any non-essential data collection

**Process**:
1. Submit request via web form or email
2. Verify identity (prevent malicious deletion)
3. Locate all copies (local, community, cloud)
4. Delete and confirm (provide deletion certificate)
5. Log request (audit trail, then also deleted after retention period)

---

## Transparency & Accountability

### Regular Reporting

**Quarterly Transparency Report** (published openly):

1. **Data Collection Summary**
   - What data types collected (sensor, network, user)
   - Where data is stored (devices, community servers, cloud)
   - Who has access (roles, not individuals)

2. **Escalation Log**
   - How much data left local network (bytes per day)
   - Where it went (service, location, purpose)
   - Why it was necessary (justification)

3. **Incidents**
   - Security breaches (if any)
   - Data leaks (if any)
   - How we responded, what we fixed

4. **Access Requests**
   - How many users requested their data
   - How many deletion requests
   - How many law enforcement requests (generalized)

### Community Review

**Annual Data Governance Meeting**:

- Review retention policies
- Adjust escalation rules
- Vote on research data sharing
- Elect data stewards (rotating responsibility)

**Stewards**:
- Community members (not vendors or corporations)
- Serve 2-year terms (staggered)
- Can audit logs, approve exceptions, enforce policy

---

## Exceptions & Emergency Override

### When Escalation is Immediate

**Safety-critical situations**:

- Fire/smoke detection → Emergency services (no delay)
- Medical emergency → Health responders (call 911)
- Security threat → Community alert system

**Principle**: Human life > privacy. But log everything, review post-incident.

### Research Data Requests

**Academic or public-interest research**:

1. Researcher submits proposal (public, community review)
2. Community votes (simple majority or steward approval)
3. If approved: Anonymized dataset generated
4. Researcher signs data agreement (usage limits, no re-identification attempts)
5. Results published openly (no proprietary research on community data)

### Government Requests

**Law enforcement or regulatory**:

1. Valid warrant or subpoena required (no voluntary cooperation)
2. Narrow scope (specific user, specific timeframe, specific data)
3. Legal review (contest overbroad requests)
4. Transparency (notify user unless gag order, publish post-resolution)
5. Community notification (annual report of requests received)

log_level = info
retention_days = 30

[aggregation]
interval = hourly
stats = mean, min, max, stddev
anonymize = true

[escalation]
remote_reporting = true
remote_host = pollen-community-server.local
remote_frequency = hourly
payload = aggregated_only

[privacy]
anonymize_device_ids = true
strip_mac_addresses = true
inject_differential_noise = true
noise_epsilon = 0.1

[retention]
local_raw_days = 30
local_aggregated_years = 5
remote_delete_after_ack = true
```

## Enforcement & Compliance

### Self-Auditing

**Monthly automated checks**:
- Scan for plaintext data in wrong places
- Verify encryption on all remote connections
- Check retention policies being followed
- Review access logs for anomalies

**Alerts on**:
- Unencrypted network traffic
- Data retention exceeding policy
- Unexpected remote connections
- Failed deletion requests

### Community Oversight

**Stewards empowered to**:
- Audit any system at any time
- Request explanations for any escalation
- Shut down non-compliant systems
- Revoke credentials for violations

**Penalties for Violations**:
- First offense: Warning + mandatory fix (7 days)
- Second offense: Service suspension (30 days)
- Third offense: Permanent ban + data purge

### Legal Compliance

**We aim to exceed**:
- GDPR (EU data protection)
- CCPA (California privacy)
- HIPAA (health data, when applicable)
- SOC 2 Type II (security/availability)

**But prioritize**:
- Community values over minimum legal requirements
- Privacy over convenience
- Sovereignty over scale

## Conclusion

Local-first is a commitment, not a feature. It shapes architecture, affects performance, requires discipline. But it aligns with our deepest values:

- **Hilbert's precision** - Formal rules, verifiable properties, no hidden behaviors
- **Schauberger's flow** - Implosive systems, energy stays local, value cycles regeneratively
- **Sovereign healing** - Control over your data, community over corporation, transparency over trust

**Data is like water. Keep it local, cycle it responsibly, share it consciously. Never let it stagnate in distant reservoirs controlled by others.**
