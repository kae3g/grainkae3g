# Multi-AI Research Prompt: Cursor IDE on Alpine Linux + Wayland

## Context
We're setting up a Framework Laptop 16 (AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS, Radeon 780M) with Alpine Linux, s6 init system, Sway Wayland compositor, and musl libc. Our goal is to run Cursor IDE while maintaining Alpine's musl libc purity philosophy.

## Research Questions

### 1. Cursor IDE Installation & Compatibility
- **Primary**: How to install and run Cursor IDE on Alpine Linux with Wayland?
- **Secondary**: What are the differences between AppImage, native packages, and manual compilation approaches?
- **Tertiary**: Are there any Alpine-specific patches or configurations needed for Cursor?

### 2. musl libc Purity & Dependencies
- **Critical**: Does installing Node.js, npm, or Electron-based applications break musl libc purity?
- **Specific**: What's the difference between libgcc and glibc in the context of Alpine Linux?
- **Practical**: Which packages (libgcc, libstdc++, gcompat) are acceptable for musl libc systems?
- **Verification**: How to verify that installed packages maintain musl libc compatibility?

### 3. Wayland Integration
- **Technical**: What environment variables and flags are needed for Cursor on Wayland?
- **Performance**: Are there any Wayland-specific optimizations or issues with Cursor?
- **Compatibility**: How does Cursor handle Wayland's security model and sandboxing?

### 4. Alternative Development Environments
- **Native**: What Alpine-compatible alternatives exist (code-server, vim/emacs with LSP, etc.)?
- **Hybrid**: Can we run Cursor in a container while maintaining system purity?
- **Minimal**: What's the most lightweight way to get AI-assisted coding on Alpine?

### 5. Framework Laptop Specifics
- **Hardware**: Any Framework 16 AMD-specific considerations for running Cursor?
- **Performance**: How does Cursor perform on AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS with Radeon 780M?
- **Power**: Impact on battery life and thermal management?

## Technical Constraints
- **System**: Alpine Linux 3.22+ with musl libc
- **Init**: s6 supervision suite (not systemd)
- **Display**: Wayland with Sway compositor
- **Hardware**: Framework Laptop 16 AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS
- **Philosophy**: Maintain Alpine's lightweight, security-oriented approach

## Success Criteria
1. Cursor IDE runs smoothly on Wayland
2. System maintains musl libc purity (no glibc contamination)
3. Installation process is documented and reproducible
4. Performance is acceptable for development work
5. Power management remains efficient

## Research Methodology
1. **Package Analysis**: Examine what packages Cursor/Electron actually requires
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Trace libgcc vs glibc usage in Alpine packages
3. **Compatibility Testing**: Test different installation methods
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare with other development environments
5. **Security Assessment**: Evaluate sandboxing and security implications

## Expected Outputs
1. **Installation Guide**: Step-by-step Cursor setup on Alpine Linux ✅ **COMPLETED**
2. **Dependency Analysis**: Clear explanation of musl libc vs glibc compatibility ✅ **COMPLETED**
3. **Performance Report**: Benchmarks and optimization recommendations ✅ **COMPLETED**
4. **Alternative Recommendations**: Other viable development environments ✅ **COMPLETED**
5. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions ✅ **COMPLETED**

## RESEARCH FINDINGS SUMMARY

### ✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive Cursor IDE Integration

**Research Status**: COMPLETE - All major questions answered and documented in 9304 Part 2

### Key Discoveries

#### 1. musl libc Compatibility Challenge
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: Cursor IDE (Electron-based) requires glibc libraries
- **Philosophy Impact**: Direct installation breaks Alpine's musl libc purity
- **Solution Matrix**: 4 viable approaches identified with varying purity trade-offs

#### 2. Recommended Installation Methods (Priority Order)

**✅ PURE (Maintains musl libc philosophy):**
1. **Flatpak** - Complete isolation, no system contamination
2. **Code-server** - Web-based VS Code experience
3. **Container (Podman/Docker)** - Full isolation with GUI forwarding
4. **Native alternatives** - vim/neovim with LSP servers

**⚠️ ACCEPTABLE (Minimal compromise):**
5. **AppImage + gcompat** - Compatibility layer, documented trade-offs

**❌ CONTAMINATION (Avoid):**
- Direct glibc installation alongside musl

#### 3. Wayland Integration
- **Environment Variables**: Documented complete Electron Wayland setup
- **Sway Configuration**: Window rules and keyboard shortcuts provided
- **Performance Flags**: AMD GPU optimizations for Framework hardware

#### 4. Framework Laptop 16 Optimizations
- **CPU Scaling**: schedutil governor for development workloads
- **AMD Graphics**: RADV_PERFTEST=aco optimization
- **Power Management**: tlp and powertop integration
- **Battery Impact**: Cursor power usage monitoring

#### 5. Security Considerations
- **Sandboxing**: firejail and bubblewrap configurations
- **Permissions**: Restricted execution environments
- **Isolation**: Container-based development environments

## Research Sources
- Alpine Linux documentation and package repositories
- Cursor IDE official documentation and community forums
- Wayland protocol specifications and Electron documentation
- Framework Laptop community and hardware compatibility reports
- musl libc documentation and Alpine Linux philosophy

## Multi-AI Collaboration Notes
- **Primary AI**: Focus on technical implementation and package compatibility
- **Secondary AI**: Research alternative approaches and security considerations
- **Tertiary AI**: Validate findings and cross-reference with official documentation
- **Synthesis**: Combine insights into actionable implementation plan

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### ✅ Documentation Updated
- **9304 Part 2**: Added comprehensive "Cursor IDE Integration" section
- **Installation methods**: All 4 approaches documented with code examples
- **Verification commands**: musl libc purity monitoring scripts
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions provided

### ✅ Philosophy Assessment Complete
**musl libc Purity Evaluation:**
- **Pure Solutions**: Flatpak, containers, native tools maintain philosophy
- **Acceptable Compromise**: gcompat provides compatibility with minimal impact  
- **Contamination Avoided**: No direct glibc installation recommended

### ✅ Performance Benchmarking
**Framework Hardware Optimizations:**
- AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS CPU scaling configurations
- Radeon 780M GPU optimizations for Electron
- Battery life impact assessment and mitigation
- Memory usage optimization for development workloads

### ✅ Alternative Development Environments
**Comprehensive Coverage:**
1. **Native Stack**: neovim + LSP + tmux (pure musl)
2. **Code-server**: Browser-based VS Code experience
3. **Container Development**: Isolated glibc environments
