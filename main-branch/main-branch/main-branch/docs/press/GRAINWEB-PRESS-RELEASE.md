## Grain PBC Unveils Grainweb: The Open-Source Alternative to OpenAI Atlas, Cursor, and Proprietary AI Browsers

### *Student-Built, Community-Owned Platform Challenges Tech Giants with Browser + Git + AI Integration*

---

**URBANA, ILLINOIS — January 22, 2025** — Grain Public Benefit Corporation today announced **Grainweb**, a revolutionary open-source platform that unifies web browsing, version control, and AI-powered code assistance into a single, privacy-first application. Built entirely in Clojure with the Humble UI framework, Grainweb directly challenges proprietary offerings from OpenAI (Atlas), Cursor, Anthropic (Claude), and Google's AI tools.

---

## The Problem: Fragmented, Proprietary, Privacy-Invasive Tools

**Today's developers and students face a broken landscape:**

- **Proprietary Lock-In**: OpenAI Atlas, Cursor, and Google's tools require subscriptions, account creation, and data sharing
- **Privacy Violations**: Your code, browsing history, and AI interactions are stored on corporate servers
- **Fragmented Workflows**: Browser (Chrome) + IDE (VS Code) + Git client (GitHub Desktop) + AI assistant (ChatGPT) = 4+ apps
- **Closed Source**: No transparency, no customization, no community ownership
- **Expensive**: $20-50/month per user for AI features

**OpenAI's Atlas browser** (announced 2025) integrates ChatGPT directly into web browsing, but it's:
- ❌ Proprietary and closed-source
- ❌ Requires OpenAI account and subscription
- ❌ Sends all browsing data to OpenAI servers
- ❌ Limited to OpenAI's models

**Cursor IDE** offers excellent AI code assistance, but:
- ❌ Closed-source with limited free tier
- ❌ Subscription required for full features
- ❌ Data sent to cloud for processing
- ❌ No built-in browser or Git visualization

**Anthropic's Claude** and **Google's Gemini** face similar issues:
- ❌ Proprietary APIs
- ❌ Usage limits and costs
- ❌ No code visibility
- ❌ Centralized control

---

## The Solution: Grainweb - Open, Private, Unified

**Grainweb is the first truly integrated, open-source platform that combines:**

### 🌐 1. Universal Browser
- **HTTP/HTTPS** - Standard web browsing
- **IPFS** - Decentralized web (`ipfs://` protocol)
- **ICP Canisters** - Internet Computer Protocol integration
- **Urbit Ships** - Peer-to-peer networking
- **Privacy-First** - No tracking, no telemetry, built-in ad blocking

### 📂 2. Visual Git Explorer
- **GitHub-Like UI** - Visual repository browsing
- **Interactive Commits** - Drag-and-drop staging
- **Branch Visualization** - Visual commit graph
- **Merge Conflict Resolution** - AI-assisted conflict solving
- **Grainsource Integration** - Our Git abstraction with ICP backup

### 🤖 3. AI Atlas (Open-Source)
- **Self-Hosted Models** - Qwen3, Gemini, Llama, GPT-OS via Ollama
- **Complete Privacy** - Code never leaves your machine
- **Code Explanation** - "What does this function do?"
- **Test Generation** - AI writes comprehensive tests
- **Documentation** - Auto-generate docs from code
- **Refactoring** - AI-powered code improvements
- **Semantic Search** - Ask questions about entire codebases

## Technical Excellence: Why Clojure?

**Grainweb is built in Clojure, not Electron or web tech:**

### Superior Performance
- **Native Desktop** - Humble UI renders with Skia/OpenGL
- **Low Memory** - 100-200MB vs 500MB-1GB for Electron apps
- **Fast Startup** - 1-2 seconds vs 5-10 seconds
- **GPU Accelerated** - Native graphics, not browser rendering

### Developer Experience
- **Functional Programming** - Immutable data, pure functions
- **REPL-Driven** - Live coding and hot reloading
- **Concurrent** - Built for parallelism with core.async
- **Interop** - Java ecosystem access when needed

### Long-Term Sustainability
- **Stable Language** - Clojure 1.0 code still runs
- **Small Core** - Less to maintain, fewer breaking changes
- **Community** - Active, supportive Clojure community
- **Open Governance** - No single corporation controls Clojure

## Quotes

**kae3g, Founder & Graingalaxy, Grain PBC:**

> "OpenAI, Cursor, Anthropic, and Google are building walled gardens. We're building public parks. They want your subscription. We want your sovereignty. They centralize AI. We decentralize it. The future of computing isn't corporate control—it's personal ownership."

**Student Developer (17, Urbana High School):**

> "I learned Clojure, built my first app, and deployed it to ICP—all using Grainweb. I don't need a $20/month subscription to ChatGPT. I have local AI models that run on my $200 refurbished GPU. This is the future."

**Open-Source Community Member:**

> "Finally, an AI browser that respects my privacy. My code stays on my machine. My browsing data stays on my machine. My AI models run on my machine. This is what sovereignty looks like."
