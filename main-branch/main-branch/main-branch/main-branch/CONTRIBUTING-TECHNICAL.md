## 📚 Technical Documentation Standards

### Code Comments

**Trish's practical advice**: *"Good comments explain the 'why' behind your code, not just the 'what'. They help future contributors understand your thinking."*

```clojure
;; Glow's gentle guidance: This function creates beautiful timestamps
;; that connect our digital work to the cosmic dance of the stars
(defn generate-graintime
  "Generate a graintime timestamp with astronomical accuracy.
   
   Returns a timestamp in the format:
   {holocene-year}-{month}-{day}--{time}--{tz}--moon-{nakshatra}--asc-{sign}{degree}--sun-{house}thhouse--{author}
   
   Example: 12025-10-24--1012--PDT--moon-jyeshtha--asc-gemini022--sun-06thhouse--kae3g"
  [author]
  ;; Trish's practical implementation: Use accurate Vedic calculations
  (astro/get-accurate-graintime author))
```

### README Files

**Glow's welcoming approach**: *"README files are like welcome mats for your code. They should make people feel excited about what they're about to explore."*

```markdown
# 🌟 Your Module Name

**Welcome to this beautiful module!** ✨

*"This module does [clear description] in a way that's both powerful and easy to use."*

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Trish's practical guidance**: *"Get people up and running quickly with clear, step-by-step instructions."*

```bash
# Install the module
bb install your-module

# Use it in your project
(require '[your-module.core :as ym])

# Try it out
(ym/hello-world)
```

## 📚 Documentation

- [API Reference](docs/api.md)
- [Examples](docs/examples.md)
- [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
```

### API Documentation

**Trish's systematic approach**: *"API documentation should be comprehensive but accessible. Include examples, edge cases, and common patterns."*

```clojure
(defn your-function
  "Clear description of what this function does.
   
   Args:
     - param1: Description of the first parameter
     - param2: Description of the second parameter
   
   Returns:
     Description of what the function returns
   
   Examples:
     (your-function \"hello\" 42)
     => \"hello42\"
   
   Throws:
     - IllegalArgumentException if param1 is nil
   
   See also:
     - related-function
     - other-function"
  [param1 param2]
  ;; Implementation here
  )
```

## 🧪 Testing Standards

### Unit Tests

**Trish's quality focus**: *"Good tests are like safety nets. They give you confidence to make changes and help prevent regressions."*

```clojure
(deftest test-your-function
  (testing "basic functionality"
    (is (= "expected" (your-function "input"))))
  
  (testing "edge cases"
    (is (thrown? IllegalArgumentException 
                 (your-function nil))))
  
  (testing "error handling"
    (is (= "error" (your-function "invalid")))))
```

### Integration Tests

**Glow's holistic approach**: *"Integration tests make sure all the pieces work together beautifully. They're like checking that a puzzle fits together perfectly."*

```clojure
(deftest test-module-integration
  (testing "end-to-end workflow"
    (let [result (run-complete-workflow)]
      (is (= "success" (:status result)))
      (is (= 42 (:count result))))))
```

### Performance Tests

**Trish's efficiency focus**: *"Performance tests help us ensure our code runs smoothly and efficiently. They're like checking that a car engine runs smoothly."*

```clojure
(deftest test-performance
  (testing "function performance"
    (let [start-time (System/currentTimeMillis)
          result (your-function "test")
          end-time (System/currentTimeMillis)]
      (is (< (- end-time start-time) 100)) ; Should complete in under 100ms
      (is (= "expected" result)))))
```

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Input Validation

**Trish's security-first approach**: *"Always validate your inputs. It's like checking the ingredients before cooking - you want to make sure everything is safe."*

```clojure
(defn safe-function
  "Function with proper input validation"
  [user-input]
  ;; Validate input
  (when (nil? user-input)
    (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "Input cannot be nil")))
  
  (when (empty? user-input)
    (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "Input cannot be empty")))
  
  ;; Process validated input
  (process-input user-input))
```

### Error Handling

**Glow's gentle error handling**: *"Errors are opportunities to help users understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Handle them with care and kindness."*

```clojure
(defn robust-function
  "Function with comprehensive error handling"
  [input]
  (try
    (process-input input)
    (catch IllegalArgumentException e
      ;; Log the error for debugging
      (log/error "Invalid input provided" {:input input :error e})
      ;; Return a helpful error message
      {:error "Please provide valid input" :details (.getMessage e)})
    (catch Exception e
      ;; Log unexpected errors
      (log/error "Unexpected error occurred" {:input input :error e})
      ;; Return a generic error message
      {:error "Something went wrong. Please try again."})))
```

### Secure Coding Practices

**Trish's security checklist**: *"Security is everyone's responsibility. These practices help keep our users safe and our systems secure."*

- **Validate all inputs** from external sources
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Sanitize user-generated content** before display
- **Implement proper authentication** and authorization
- **Log security events** for monitoring
- **Keep dependencies updated** to patch vulnerabilities
- **Use secure communication** protocols (HTTPS, TLS)
- **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse

### ICP (Internet Computer) Development

**Glow's blockchain excitement**: *"ICP development is like building on a new frontier. The possibilities are endless, and your contributions help shape the future of decentralized computing."*

```motoko
// Motoko smart contract example
actor YourCanister {
    // Stable storage for upgrades
    stable var sessions : [(Text, Text)] = [];
    
    // Public function to add a session
    public func addSession(grainpath : Text, content : Text) : async () {
        sessions := Array.append(sessions, [(grainpath, content)]);
    };
    
    // Public function to get all sessions
    public query func getSessions() : async [(Text, Text)] {
        sessions
    };
}
```

### Rust Security Implementation

**Trish's security focus**: *"Rust gives us memory safety and performance. It's perfect for security-critical blockchain code."*

```rust
// Rust implementation with security focus
use std::collections::HashMap;

pub struct SessionManager {
    sessions: HashMap<String, String>,
}

impl SessionManager {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            sessions: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }
    
    pub fn add_session(&mut self, grainpath: String, content: String) -> Result<(), String> {
        // Validate input
        if grainpath.is_empty() {
            return Err("Grainpath cannot be empty".to_string());
        }
        
        if content.is_empty() {
            return Err("Content cannot be empty".to_string());
        }
        
        // Add session
        self.sessions.insert(grainpath, content);
        Ok(())
    }
    
    pub fn get_session(&self, grainpath: &str) -> Option<&String> {
        self.sessions.get(grainpath)
    }
}
```

### Cross-Chain Communication

**Glow's bridge-building vision**: *"Cross-chain communication is like building bridges between different worlds. Your contributions help create a more connected and interoperable future."*

```clojure
(defn cross-chain-transfer
  "Transfer assets between different blockchain networks"
  [from-chain to-chain amount]
  ;; Validate chains
  (when-not (valid-chain? from-chain)
    (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "Invalid source chain")))
  
  (when-not (valid-chain? to-chain)
    (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "Invalid destination chain")))
  
  ;; Validate amount
  (when-not (positive? amount)
    (throw (IllegalArgumentException. "Amount must be positive")))
  
  ;; Execute cross-chain transfer
  (execute-transfer from-chain to-chain amount))
```
