# kae3g 9998: A Comprehensive Learning Path for Modern Init Systems — SixOS, OpenRC, runit, and Rust

**Timestamp:** 12025-10-10--rhizome-valley  
**Series:** Technical Writings (9999 → 0000)  
**Category:** System Architecture, Init Systems, Self-Education, Engineering Excellence  
**Reading Time:** 90 minutes

## The Question

*How do we master alternative init systems (SixOS, OpenRC, runit) and Rust-based supervision frameworks to build state-of-the-art systems worthy of top engineering companies like SpaceX and xAI?*

## Introduction: The Path of Mastery

In the journey from 9999 (Clojure & Nix ecosystem) through the philosophical foundations we've explored, we arrive at a practical question: **How do we learn these systems deeply enough to contribute to cutting-edge engineering?**

This is not a casual learning plan. This is a **roadmap to mastery**—structured for self-directed learners who aspire to work at companies pushing the boundaries of technology.

```clojure
{:the-learning-philosophy
 "Knowledge without practice is sterile.
  Practice without understanding is blind.
  
  This plan interweaves:
  - Conceptual foundations (why init systems matter)
  - Hands-on experimentation (build, break, rebuild)
  - Design synthesis (create your own solutions)
  - Real-world application (SpaceX-level rigor)"}

# Part I: What is SixOS?

## Understanding the Design Intent

**SixOS** (also spelled "Sixos") is a **NixOS variant without systemd**, announced publicly in January 2025 at the 38th Chaos Communication Congress (38C3). It's a two-year project aimed at creating a more modular, secure, and declarative system.

```clojure
{:sixos-overview
 {:what-is-it
  "A Nixpkgs-based OS that replaces systemd with skarnet's s6 supervisor
   Announced at 38C3 in January 2025
   Result of 2-year design exploration"
  
  :key-innovation-infuse
  "Services managed like packages in nixpkgs
   'Infusion' resolves and sets up services similar to Nix package builds
   Declarative service configuration with atomic activation"
  
  :design-goals
  ["Eliminate systemd's perceived complexities"
   "Maintain NixOS-like atomic, immutable configurations"
   "Embrace Unix philosophy (modularity, simplicity)"
   "Owner-booted security (no unencrypted storage except EEPROM)"
   "Compatibility with Nix ecosystems"]
  
  :vs-nixos
  {:nixos "systemd integration, ~1.5MB binary, binary logs"
   :sixos "s6 supervision suite, ~200KB binaries, text logs"}}
 
 :s6-supervision-suite
 {:components
  ["s6: service supervision"
   "s6-rc: service manager"
   "s6-linux-init: init system"
   "All written in C, highly portable, minimal footprint"]
  
  :philosophy
  "Each tool does one thing well
   Composable components
   No feature creep"}}
```

## The "Infuse" Combinator

```clojure
{:infuse-concept
 "Key innovation that sets SixOS apart:
  
  Traditional NixOS:
  - systemd services defined in module system
  - Complex dependencies, hard to reason about
  - Monolithic activation
  
  SixOS with 'infuse':
  - Services are 'infused' like packages
  - Declarative resolution at build time
  - Atomic activation with rollback
  - Each service = derivation
  
  Example mental model:
  
  (defn infuse [service-spec]
    (let [deps (resolve-dependencies service-spec)
          closure (build-closure deps)
          activation-script (generate-s6-scripts closure)]
      {:service-path (store-in-nix closure)
       :activation activation-script
       :rollback-generation (- current-gen 1)}))"}
```

## The infuse.nix Paradigm: A Rich Hickey & Ecological Farming Perspective

### For the Apprentice: What is infuse.nix?

**To a 7th Grader:**

Imagine you have a huge LEGO castle you've built over many months. It has towers, secret rooms, tiny furniture, and decorations deep inside. Now you want to change one specific red brick way down in a hidden room to blue—but you don't want to knock down the whole castle or mess up other rooms.

**infuse.nix** is like a magic instruction manual that says: "Go to the main tower → through the secret door → into the treasure room → and change JUST that one brick to blue." It uses little notes (called **functions**) that tell it whether to:
- **Merge**: Add the new brick next to old ones (keep both)
- **Replace**: Kick out the old brick and put in only the new one

You can even chain these instructions like a recipe: "First add a window here, then paint that wall there, then swap that brick." It's way better than rebuilding the whole castle, and it keeps everything strong without breaking!

---

### For the Junior Developer: Technical Foundations

#### Core Concept: Deep, Path-Based, Functional Overriding

```clojure
{:infuse-paradigm-definition
 "infuse.nix is a library that enables DEEP, PRECISE overrides 
  in Nix's nested data structures (attribute sets, lists, functions).
  
  Problem it solves:
  - Nix's recursiveUpdate is shallow (only top-level merging)
  - Manual deep updates require verbose, nested .override calls
  - Hard to maintain, debug, and reason about
  
  Solution:
  - Path-based targeting (like XPath for Nix)
  - Functional markers control merge vs replace
  - Algebraic laws ensure predictability
  - Syntactic sugar reduces boilerplate"}
```

#### Glossary for Apprentices

```clojure
{:key-terms
 {:attribute-set
  "Nix's primary data structure, like JSON objects or Python dicts.
   Example: { name = \"nginx\"; port = 80; ssl.enabled = true; }
   Can be nested infinitely deep."
  
  :path-based-override
  "Specifying changes using dot-separated paths.
   Instead of: pkg.override { ssl = { enabled = false; }; }
   Use infuse: pkg with path 'ssl.enabled' set to false
   Clearer intent, fewer parentheses."
  
  :functional-marker
  "A small function that wraps a value to control merging behavior.
   - _: newValue  →  'clobber' (replace entirely)
   - value: value + newValue  →  'merge' (combine with existing)
   Example: { port = _: 8080; }  replaces port completely"
  
  :clobber-vs-merge
  "Two strategies for overriding:
   - Clobber: Wipe out old value, use new one (destructive)
   - Merge: Combine old and new (additive)
   infuse lets you choose per-path"
  
  :algebraic-laws
  "Mathematical properties that make infuse predictable:
   - Identity: infuse target {} = target (no change)
   - Associativity: infuse (infuse x a) b = infuse x (a then b)
   These laws mean you can reason about combinations safely."
  
  :syntactic-sugar
  "Shortcuts that expand to full functions.
   - __assign = clobber (replace)
   - __append = add to list
   - __overlay = apply function to value
   Custom sugars can be added for domain-specific tasks."}
 
 :why-it-matters-for-sixos
 "SixOS uses infuse to treat services like Nix packages:
  - Each service.nix is an attribute set
  - Override ports, env vars, dependencies via paths
  - Generate s6-rc service bundles (directories with run scripts)
  - Enable multiple instances with different configs
  
  Traditional NixOS modules can't easily run multiple instances
  of same service—infuse makes this trivial."}
```

### Rich Hickey's "Simple Made Easy" Applied to infuse.nix

#### The Problem: Complexity vs Simplicity

```clojure
{:rich-hickey-analysis
 {:complex-approach
  "Traditional Nix overrides are COMPLECTED (braided together):
   
   pythonPackages.override (prev: prev // {
     packageOverrides = lib.composeExtensions 
       (prev.packageOverrides or {}) 
       (final: prev: {
         dnspython = prev.dnspython.overrideAttrs (old: { doCheck = false; });
       });
   });
   
   Problems:
   - Many concepts intertwined (override, compose, merge, attrs)
   - Hard to see WHAT you're changing (buried in nesting)
   - Hard to test individual pieces
   - Error messages point to wrong locations"
  
  :simple-approach
  "infuse.nix SEPARATES concerns:
   
   infuse pythonPackages {
     packageOverrides.__overlay.dnspython.__output.doCheck.__assign = false;
   }
   
   Benefits:
   - Clear PATH shows exactly what changes
   - Each segment is independent and testable
   - __assign explicitly states 'replace this value'
   - Errors point to exact path that failed"
  
  :hickey-quote
  "\"Simplicity is about lack of interleaving, not 'easy to use.'
    Complex things have many parts braided together.
    Simple things have one role, one concept, one dimension.\"
    
   infuse.nix achieves SIMPLICITY by:
   - One concept: path-based transformation
   - One dimension: target → infusions → result
   - No interleaving: each path is independent"}
 
 :repl-driven-development
 "Rich Hickey emphasizes REPL for immediate feedback:
  
  # In Nix REPL (nix repl '<nixpkgs>')
  nix-repl> let infuse = import <infuse-nix>;
  nix-repl> infuse { x = 3; } { x = x: x * x; }
  { x = 9; }
  
  nix-repl> infuse { a.b.c = 10; } { a.b.c.__assign = 20; }
  { a = { b = { c = 20; }; }; }
  
  Immediate feedback loop:
  1. Define structure
  2. Apply infusion
  3. See result instantly
  4. Iterate
  
  This is the LISP/Clojure way brought to Nix!"}
```

### Ecological Farm Metaphor: Helen Atthowe's Organic Systems

#### The Living Soil: Nix Configuration as Ecosystem

```clojure
{:ecological-metaphor
 {:base-soil
  "Your Nix configuration is like SOIL in a permaculture garden.
   - Layers of nutrients (packages, services, system config)
   - Microorganisms (dependencies, build processes)
   - Structure and texture (module relationships)
   
   Helen Atthowe teaches: Don't till the soil unnecessarily.
   Preserve the living structure, add amendments thoughtfully."
  
  :infuse-as-compost
  "infuse.nix is like COMPOST tea infused into soil:
   - Targeted nutrients to specific zones (paths)
   - Doesn't disrupt overall soil structure
   - Enriches without replacement
   - Can be applied repeatedly, building up benefits
   
   Example:
   Base config (soil): nginx with default settings
   Infusion (compost): Add SSL, keep everything else
   
   infuse nginxBase {
     ssl.enabled = true;
     ssl.certificate.__assign = \"/path/to/cert\";
   }
   
   Result: Enriched nginx, soil structure intact"
  
  :polyculture-principle
  "Monoculture farms (single crop) are fragile.
   Polyculture (diverse crops) is resilient.
   
   Nix monoculture:
   - One big configuration.nix file
   - Hard to understand, harder to change
   
   Nix polyculture with infuse:
   - Many small service.nix files
   - Each is composable, testable
   - Combine via infusion for diversity
   - Failure in one doesn't cascade
   
   This is UNIX philosophy + permaculture!"
  
  :no-till-philosophy
  "Fukuoka and Atthowe: Minimize intervention, let nature work.
   
   Traditional Nix: Rewrite entire config for small change (tilling soil)
   infuse.nix: Precise amendments (no-till, cover crops)
   
   Example (service restart without full rebuild):
   Instead of: Rebuild entire NixOS system
   With infuse: Update just the service derivation
   
   infuse services.myapp {
     environment.LOG_LEVEL.__assign = \"debug\";
   }
   
   Deploy: Only myapp service changes, rest of system untouched
   Like adding mulch to one bed, not plowing whole farm"
  
  :companion-planting
  "Atthowe plants beans with corn (nitrogen fixation).
   
   In infuse.nix: Companion services via overlays
   
   infuse services {
     postgresql = basePostgres;
     myapp = {
       depends-on = [ \"postgresql\" ];
       environment.DB_HOST.__assign = \"localhost\";
     };
   }
   
   Services grow together, supporting each other
   Like beans climbing corn stalks—natural dependency"}
 
 :veganic-fruitfulness
 "Veganic farming: Abundant yields without animal inputs.
  infuse.nix: Abundant configs without boilerplate 'manure'
  
  Old way (animal inputs = verbose overrides):
  services.nginx.override (old: recursiveUpdate old {
    virtualHosts.\"example.com\".ssl = {
      enable = true;
      certificate = /path;
    };
  });
  
  Veganic way (clean, plant-based simplicity):
  infuse services.nginx {
    virtualHosts.\"example.com\".ssl.enable = true;
    virtualHosts.\"example.com\".ssl.certificate.__assign = /path;
  }
  
  Result: Same fruitfulness (working config), cleaner inputs"}
```

### Practical Examples: From Apprentice to Senior

#### Example 1: Basic Attrset Override (Apprentice Level)

```nix
# Problem: Change nginx port without losing other settings

# Traditional (risky—might lose ssl config):
services.nginx = { port = 8080; };  # Oops, ssl disappeared!

# With infuse (safe):
infuse services.nginx { port.__assign = 8080; }
# Result: { port = 8080; ssl = { ... }; }  # ssl preserved
```

**Apprentice Question:** "Why does `__assign` matter?"

**Answer:** Without `__assign`, Nix tries to call `8080` as a function (it's not!). The `__assign` sugar expands to `port = _: 8080;` which says "ignore old value (`_`), use new value (`8080`)."

#### Example 2: List Pipelining (Junior Level)

```nix
# Problem: Apply multiple transformations in sequence

# Squared then increment:
infuse { x = 3; } [
  { x = x: x * x; }       # 3 → 9
  (result: result.x + 1)  # 9 → 10
]
# Result: { x = 10; }

# For services (real-world):
infuse services.myapp [
  { environment.NODE_ENV.__assign = "production"; }
  { replicas = r: r * 2; }  # Double replicas
  { resources.memory.__append = "512Mi"; }
]
```

**Junior Developer Task:** "Chain 3 transformations to a service config. Explain what each does."

#### Example 3: Deep Nested Override (Mid-Level)

```nix
# Problem: Modify deeply nested value in package overlay

# Traditional (verbose):
final: prev: {
  python311 = prev.python311.override (oldArgs: oldArgs // {
    packageOverrides = lib.composeExtensions 
      (oldArgs.packageOverrides or (_: _: {})) 
      (self: super: {
        dnspython = super.dnspython.overrideAttrs (old: {
          doCheck = false;
        });
      });
  });
}

# With infuse (clear):
final: prev: infuse prev {
  python311.__input.packageOverrides.__overlay.dnspython.__output.doCheck.__assign = false;
}
```

**Understanding the Path:**
- `python311`: Target package
- `__input`: Arguments to `.override`
- `packageOverrides`: Nested in override args
- `__overlay`: It's a function overlay (extends existing)
- `dnspython`: Specific sub-package
- `__output`: Result of overrideAttrs
- `doCheck.__assign`: Final value to set

**Mid-Level Question:** "Draw the tree structure this path represents. Where would you add a new package?"

#### Example 4: SixOS Service with s6-rc (Senior Level)

```nix
# SixOS service: PostgreSQL with custom config

# File: svcs/by-name/postgresql/service.nix
{ lib, infuse, pkgs, ... }:

let
  basePostgres = {
    name = "postgresql";
    run = "${pkgs.postgresql}/bin/postgres -D /var/lib/postgresql/data";
    env = {
      PGDATA = "/var/lib/postgresql/data";
      POSTGRES_USER = "postgres";
    };
    dependencies = [ "network.target" ];
  };
  
in {
  # Default instance
  default = basePostgres;
  
  # Custom instance for testing (infused override)
  testing = infuse basePostgres {
    name.__assign = "postgresql-testing";
    env.POSTGRES_DB.__assign = "testdb";
    env.PGPORT.__assign = "5433";  # Non-standard port
    run = run: "${run} -p 5433";  # Append port to command
  };
  
  # High-performance instance (multiple infusions)
  performance = infuse basePostgres [
    { env.POSTGRES_SHARED_BUFFERS.__assign = "256MB"; }
    { env.POSTGRES_MAX_CONNECTIONS.__assign = "200"; }
    { run = r: "${r} -c shared_buffers=256MB"; }
  ];
}

# In system config, choose instance:
services.postgresql = pkgs.callPackage ./svcs/by-name/postgresql/service.nix {
  inherit lib infuse;
}.performance;

# Result: s6-rc bundle generated with performance settings
# Lives at: /nix/store/...-postgresql-performance-s6-rc/run
```

**Senior Developer Exercise:**

"Modify this to support:
1. Read-only replica (different port, replication config)
2. SSL-enabled instance (cert paths, pg_hba.conf mods)
3. Generate s6 `finish` script for graceful shutdown

Use infuse to create 3 new instances without duplicating base config."

## Part Ib: Microkernel Foundations — seL4 and Redox OS

### Why Microkernels Matter for Init Systems

```clojure
{:microkernel-philosophy
 "Traditional monolithic kernels (Linux):
  - Everything in kernel space (drivers, fs, networking)
  - One bug can crash entire system
  - Hard to verify, audit, secure
  
  Microkernel approach:
  - Minimal kernel (scheduling, IPC, memory management)
  - Everything else in userspace (drivers, services)
  - Failures isolated to user processes
  - Easier to verify formally
  
  Connection to init systems:
  - SixOS/s6: Userspace process supervision (like microkernel for services)
  - seL4: Formally verified kernel (ultimate trust base)
  - Redox OS: Rust safety + microkernel isolation
  
  Learning both gives you complete picture of system design"}
```

### seL4: The Verified Microkernel

#### For Apprentices: What is Formal Verification?

**Glossary Entry:**

```clojure
{:formal-verification
 {:definition
  "Mathematical proof that software does EXACTLY what specification says.
   Not testing (finite cases), but PROOF (all possible cases)."
  
  :analogy
  "Testing: Check if bridge holds 100 cars, 200 cars, 500 cars...
   Verification: Prove mathematically bridge holds ANY number ≤ 1000 cars
   
   For seL4: Prove kernel NEVER has security bugs, NEVER crashes"
  
  :how-it-works
  "1. Write specification (what kernel should do) in formal logic
   2. Write C implementation
   3. Use proof assistant (Isabelle/HOL) to prove C matches spec
   4. Proof covers: memory safety, no crashes, correct behavior
   
   Result: seL4 is world's only OS kernel with this level of proof"}}
```

#### seL4 Architecture for Junior Developers

```clojure
{:sel4-architecture
 {:kernel-size "~10,000 lines of C (vs Linux ~30 million!)"
  :verification-effort "11 person-years of proof work"
  
  :core-abstractions
  {:capabilities
   "Think: unforgeable tickets that grant specific permissions.
    - Read/write memory region X
    - Send message on IPC channel Y
    - Manage thread Z
    
    Can't be forged, copied without permission, or used after revoked.
    Like train tickets that conductor verifies."
   
   :threads-and-scheduling
   "Kernel provides threads with priority-based scheduling.
    User space decides policies (round-robin, earliest-deadline-first).
    Kernel just enforces: highest priority runnable thread executes."
   
   :inter-process-communication
   "Synchronous message passing via endpoints.
    - Endpoint = capability-protected channel
    - Send: Block until receiver ready
    - Receive: Block until sender ready
    - Fast: ~200 cycles on ARM (vs Linux syscall ~1000 cycles)"
   
   :memory-management
   "Capability-based:
    - Untyped memory (raw pages)
    - Retype to typed (page tables, TCBs, endpoints)
    - Hierarchical: Parent capability controls children
    - Revoke: Destroy capability, all derived caps vanish
    
    This prevents:
    - Use-after-free (cap revoked = can't access)
    - Buffer overflow exploits (memory bounds in caps)"}}
 
 :api-example
 "// Allocate memory and create thread
  
  seL4_Untyped untyped_cap = /* from bootinfo */;
  
  // Retype untyped memory into thread control block
  seL4_CPtr tcb_cap;
  seL4_Untyped_Retype(
    untyped_cap,    // Source: untyped memory
    seL4_TCBObject,  // Type: thread control block
    0,              // Size: 0 for TCBs
    seL4_CapInitThreadCNode,  // Dest CNode
    0,              // Dest index
    0,              // Dest depth
    &tcb_cap,       // Output: capability to TCB
    1               // Number of objects
  );
  
  // Configure and start thread
  seL4_TCB_Configure(tcb_cap, fault_ep, priority, cspace, vspace, ...);
  seL4_TCB_Resume(tcb_cap);
  
  // Send message via IPC
  seL4_MessageInfo_t msg = seL4_MessageInfo_new(0, 0, 0, 1);
  seL4_SetMR(0, 42);  // Message register 0 = 42
  seL4_Send(endpoint_cap, msg);"
 
 :why-it-matters
 "For init systems:
  - seL4 provides VERIFIED foundation (no kernel bugs)
  - Build supervisor on top (like SixOS on seL4)
  - Each service gets isolated capability space
  - Service crash can't affect kernel or other services
  
  Imagine: SixOS infuse.nix generating seL4 capability grants
  Each s6 service runs in verified isolation"}
```

#### Learning Path for seL4

```clojure
{:sel4-learning-steps
 {:week-1
  ["Read seL4 whitepaper (overview of verification)"
   "Set up seL4 microkit (simplified framework)"
   "Run 'hello world' protected by seL4"
   "Understand: kernel vs userspace separation"]

  ["Study capability system (unforgeable references)"
   "Implement: Two processes communicating via IPC"

```

### Redox OS: Rust Meets Microkernel

#### For Apprentices: Why Rust for an OS Kernel?

```clojure
{:rust-for-kernels
 {:memory-safety
  "C/C++ problems (cause most kernel bugs):
   - Use-after-free: Access memory after deallocating it
   - Buffer overflows: Write past array bounds
   - Data races: Two threads modify same data unsafely
   
   Rust prevents ALL of these at compile time:
   - Ownership: Only one owner can modify data
   - Borrowing: Strict rules for sharing references
   - Lifetimes: Compiler tracks when data is valid
   
   Result: Write kernel code, compiler PROVES it's safe"
  
  :zero-cost-abstractions
  "Rust abstractions (iterators, closures) compile to same
   machine code as hand-written C loops.
   
   Get high-level safety WITHOUT performance cost."
  
  :no-garbage-collector
  "Unlike Java/Go, Rust has NO GC pauses.
   Memory freed deterministically when owner goes out of scope.
   Essential for real-time systems, kernels."}
 
 :analogy-for-seventh-grader
 "C is like building with LEGOs but no instruction manual.
  You CAN build anything, but might stack pieces wrong and they fall.
  
  Rust is like building with LEGOs that click together properly.
  If pieces don't fit, they won't connect—compiler stops you.
  
  Result: C = fast but error-prone, Rust = fast AND safe"}
```

#### Redox OS Architecture

```clojure
{:redox-architecture
 {:microkernel-design
  "Kernel (~16,000 lines Rust):
   - Memory management (paging, allocation)
   - Process/thread scheduling
   - Inter-process communication (schemes)
   - System calls (minimal set)
   
   Everything else in userspace:
   - File systems (RedoxFS, FATFS)
   - Drivers (USB, networking, graphics)
   - Network stack (smoltcp - pure Rust TCP/IP)
   - Display server (orbital - Wayland-like)"
  
  :scheme-system
  "Redox's unique IPC: URL-like namespaces called 'schemes'
   
   Examples:
   - file:     File system access
   - tcp:      Network sockets
   - display:  GUI rendering
   - usb:      USB device communication
   
   Access via paths:
   - file:///home/user/doc.txt
   - tcp://example.com:80
   - display:window/1
   
   Each scheme handled by userspace daemon.
   Kernel routes messages via capability-like handles."
  
  :drivers-as-services
  "All drivers run in userspace:
   
   Example: USB driver
   1. Kernel grants capability to USB hardware
   2. Driver reads/writes via memory-mapped I/O
   3. Other processes request USB access via 'usb:' scheme
   4. Driver validates requests, mediates access
   
   Driver crash: Only driver dies, kernel/other services unaffected"}
 
 :api-example
 "// Redox OS: Open file and read (looks like Unix!)
  
  use std::fs::File;
  use std::io::Read;
  
  fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
      let mut file = File::open(\"file:///etc/passwd\")?;
      let mut contents = String::new();
      file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
      println!(\"{}\", contents);
      Ok(())
  }
  
  // Under the hood:
  // 1. open(\"file:///etc/passwd\") → kernel routes to RedoxFS daemon
  // 2. RedoxFS daemon checks permissions, returns file handle
  // 3. read() → kernel sends request to RedoxFS, gets data
  // 4. Rust's borrow checker PROVES no use-after-free!"
 
 :init-system-integration
 "Redox uses init process similar to SysV init:
  - Kernel starts /bin/init as PID 1
  - Init reads /etc/init.d/rc for services
  - Starts daemons (schemes, drivers) in dependency order
  
  Could be replaced with s6-style supervisor:
  - Rust rewrite of s6 (memory-safe supervision)
  - Generate service dirs from Nix expressions
  - Combine: Redox kernel + Rust supervisor + infuse.nix
  
  This is the FUTURE: Verified base (like seL4) + Rust safety + Nix reproducibility"}

## Enhanced Learning Roadmap: Integrating Cosmopolitan Portability

### The Complete Vision

```clojure
{:integrated-learning-path
 "Building on the infuse.nix paradigm, microkernel foundations,
  and now adding Cosmopolitan libc portability layer.
  
  The journey:
  Week 1-2:  Foundations (conceptual why)

  Week 5-6:  Rust interop and synthesis
  Week 7-8:  Real-world application with Cosmopolitan

## Phase 0: Foundations (1-2 Weeks)

**Goal:** Understand init systems, service supervision, and why alternatives to systemd exist.

### Core Concepts to Master

```clojure
{:init-system-fundamentals
 {:pid-1-responsibilities
  ["First userspace process (parent of all processes)"
   "Bootstrap system from kernel handoff"
   "Reap zombie processes"
   "Handle system shutdown"]
  
  :service-vs-supervision
  {:init "Starts services in order (SysV, OpenRC)"
   :supervision "Keeps services running, restarts on failure (runit, s6)"
   :hybrid "Both (systemd, SixOS)"}
  
  :dependency-management
  {:none "Services start independently (runit)"
   :implicit "Shell script dependencies (SysV)"
   :explicit "Declared dependencies (OpenRC, systemd)"
   :functional "Build-time resolution (SixOS)"}}}
```

### Reading List

1. **"A Survey of Init Systems"** — Overview of sysvinit, Upstart, systemd, s6, runit, OpenRC
2. **"The Tragedy of Systemd"** (Benno Rice, 2019) — Criticisms that motivate projects like SixOS
3. **Nix Manual** — Declarative configs section (nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/)
4. **38C3 Talk**: "sixos: a nix os without systemd" by Adam Joseph (45-60 minutes)

### Hands-On Exercise 1

**Build a Simple Service Stack:**

```bash
# On a minimal Linux VM (Alpine or Debian)
# Implement: db → app → web

1. Database service (PostgreSQL or Redis)
   - Starts on boot
   - Logs to /var/log/db.log
   - Auto-restarts on failure

2. App service (Node.js or Python)
   - Depends on database being up
   - Logs structured JSON

3. Web service (Nginx or Caddy)
   - Depends on app being up
   - Proxies to app
```

**Do this under:**
- OpenRC (Alpine Linux)
- runit (Void Linux)
- Document the differences

### Deliverable

**Artifact:** A one-page comparison matrix showing:
- Boot time
- Dependency resolution mechanism
- Restart behavior
- Logging strategy
- Complexity (lines of config)

---

## Phase 1: SixOS Deep Dive (2-3 Weeks)

**Goal:** Understand SixOS architecture, design rationale, and current state.

### Research Tasks

1. **Locate All Artifacts:**
   - GitHub repos (search: "sixos" or "six os")
   - Codeberg repo: https://codeberg.org/amjoseph/sixos
   - 38C3 slides: `sixos-talk_AeFJi9n.pdf`
   - Discourse thread: "sixos: a nix os without systemd"

2. **Dissect the Design:**
   ```clojure
   {:questions-to-answer
    ["What does 'without systemd' mean? Replacement or re-wire?"
     "How does 'infuse' differ from NixOS module override semantics?"
     "Does SixOS require rewriting existing modules?"
     "How are timers, socket activation, logging handled?"
     "What about cgroups, user units, system slices?"
     "Where does ownerboot fit in the security model?"]}
   ```

3. **Map NixOS → SixOS:**
   - Which NixOS features break?
   - Which are preserved?
   - What new capabilities emerge?

### Hands-On Exercise 2

**Build SixOS from Source:**

```bash
# Clone SixOS repo
git clone https://codeberg.org/amjoseph/sixos.git
cd sixos

# Build minimal configuration
nix build .#nixosConfigurations.minimal-sixos.config.system.build.vm

# Run in QEMU
result/bin/run-nixos-vm

# Observe boot process
# Compare to NixOS boot
```

### Deliverable

**Artifact:** Markdown document titled "SixOS Architecture Analysis"

```markdown
# SixOS Architecture Analysis

## Subsystems
- Service management (s6-rc)
- Mount handling (?)
- Login management (?)
- Timer/cron equivalent (?)

## Missing Pieces
- Socket activation (how to implement?)
- D-Bus integration (needed?)
- Container support (systemd-nspawn alternative?)

## Risk Areas
- Migration path from NixOS
- Third-party module compatibility
- Production readiness timeline
```

---

## Phase 2: OpenRC & runit Mastery (2-3 Weeks)

**Goal:** Become proficient in battle-tested alternatives to systemd.

### OpenRC Deep Dive

```clojure
{:openrc-architecture
 {:core-concepts
  ["Runlevels (boot, default, shutdown)"
   "Service scripts in /etc/init.d/"
   "Dependency resolution via depend() function"
   "supervise-daemon for built-in supervision"]

   command_args=\"--config /etc/my-app.conf\"
   command_user=\"appuser:appgroup\"
   
   depend() {
     need net
     use dns logger
     after firewall
   }
   
   start_pre() {
     checkpath --directory --owner $command_user /var/run/my-app
   }"}
 
 :openrc-strengths
 ["Works on Linux and BSD"
  "Shell-based (familiar to Unix admins)"
  "Can integrate with runit or s6 for supervision"
  "Parallel service startup based on dependencies"]}
```

### runit Deep Dive

```clojure
{:runit-architecture
 {:three-stage-boot
  "Stage 1: /etc/runit/1 (one-time setup: mount filesystems, set hostname)
   Stage 2: /etc/runit/2 (start runsvdir, supervise all services)
   Stage 3: /etc/runit/3 (shutdown: stop services, unmount)"}
 
 :service-directory-structure
 "/etc/sv/my-service/
   run         # Start script (exec my-daemon)
   finish      # Cleanup after exit
   log/run     # Dedicated logging (svlogd)
   supervise/  # Runtime state (created automatically)"
 
 :supervision-commands
 ["sv up my-service      # Start service"
  "sv down my-service    # Stop service"
  "sv restart my-service # Restart"
  "sv status my-service  # Check status"
  "sv check my-service   # Exit 0 if running"]}
```

### Hands-On Exercise 3

**Re-implement Your Stack:**

Take the `db → app → web` stack from Phase 0 and implement it under:

1. **OpenRC** (on Alpine or Gentoo):
   - Write init scripts with proper dependencies
   - Configure runlevels
   - Test boot ordering
   - Implement log rotation

2. **runit** (on Void or Artix):
   - Create service directories
   - Write run scripts
   - Set up logging with svlogd
   - Test supervision (kill process, watch restart)

3. **s6** (if time permits):
   - Use s6-rc for service management
   - Compare with runit

### Advanced Challenge

**Hybrid System:**

```bash
# On Artix Linux (supports multiple inits)
# Use OpenRC for dependency management
# Use runit for service supervision

# Example: PostgreSQL service
# /etc/init.d/postgresql (OpenRC)
#!/sbin/openrc-run

supervisor=runit
command="/usr/bin/postgres"

depend() {
  need net
  use dns
}

# OpenRC creates runit service directory automatically
# runit supervises the actual process
```

### Deliverable

**Artifact:** Comparative write-up showing equivalent services under OpenRC, runit, and systemd.

Include:
- Complexity comparison (lines of config)
- Boot time benchmarks
- Failure handling (kill service, observe restart)
- Logging comparison

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut supervisor = Supervisor::new();
    supervisor.load_config("services.toml")?;

    }
    
    // Supervise forever
    supervisor.supervise().await;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

**Configuration Example:**

```toml
# services.toml
[[service]]
name = "database"
command = ["postgres", "-D", "/var/lib/postgresql/data"]
depends_on = []
auto_restart = true
restart_delay_secs = 5

[[service]]
name = "web-app"
command = ["node", "server.js"]
depends_on = ["database"]
auto_restart = true
restart_delay_secs = 3
```

### Hands-On Exercise 4

**Extend Your Supervisor:**

Add features incrementally:

1. **Logging:** Capture stdout/stderr to files
2. **Signals:** Handle SIGTERM, SIGINT gracefully
3. **User switching:** Run services as specific users
4. **Resource limits:** CPU, memory constraints (via cgroups-rs)
5. **Health checks:** HTTP/TCP probes for readiness
6. **Hot reload:** Update service config without restart

### Integration with SixOS

```clojure
{:sixos-rust-integration
 "Design a bridge where:
  
  1. SixOS generates service manifests (TOML/JSON) from Nix expressions
  2. Your Rust supervisor reads these manifests
  3. Rust layer manages actual process supervision
  4. SixOS handles:
     - Dependency resolution at build time
     - Atomic activation
     - Rollback capability
  5. Rust handles:
     - Runtime supervision
     - Restart policies
     - Health monitoring"}
```

### Deliverable

**Artifact:** A working Rust service supervisor that:
- Reads declarative config
- Starts services respecting dependencies
- Monitors and restarts failed services
- Logs structured events
- Can run as PID 1 in a container

---

## Phase 4: Design Synthesis (2-3 Weeks)

**Goal:** Combine SixOS concepts with Rust supervision to create a hybrid system.

### Architecture Design

```clojure
{:hybrid-architecture
 {:layer-1-nix
  "SixOS/Nix layer (build time):
   - Resolve all dependencies
   - Generate service closures
   - Create deployment manifests
   - Handle system configuration"
  
  :layer-2-rust
  "Rust supervisor layer (runtime):
   - Read Nix-generated manifests
   - Supervise processes
   - Handle restarts, health checks
   - Emit structured logs"
  
  :data-flow
  "flake.nix → infuse → service-manifest.json → rust-supervisor → running-services"}
 
 :example-manifest
 {:generated-by-sixos
  "{
     \"services\": [
       {
         \"name\": \"postgresql\",
         \"nix_path\": \"/nix/store/abc123-postgresql-15.3/bin/postgres\",
         \"args\": [\"-D\", \"/var/lib/postgresql/data\"],
         \"user\": \"postgres\",
         \"depends_on\": [],
         \"auto_restart\": true
       },
       {
         \"name\": \"web-app\",
         \"nix_path\": \"/nix/store/def456-my-app/bin/server\",
         \"args\": [],
         \"user\": \"www\",
         \"depends_on\": [\"postgresql\"],
         \"auto_restart\": true
       }
     ]
   }"}}}
```

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Translate SixOS service specs to Rust manifest:**
   ```nix
   # In SixOS configuration
   services.my-app = {
     enable = true;
     package = pkgs.my-app;
     user = "myapp";
     after = [ "postgresql.service" ];
   };
   
   # Generate manifest.json via Nix derivation
   ```

2. **Boot Integration:**
   ```bash
   # Stage 1: SixOS init (s6-linux-init)
   # Stage 2: Launch Rust supervisor with manifest
   # Stage 3: Rust supervisor manages services
   ```

3. **Missing Features:**
   - Timers: Use Rust's tokio for scheduled tasks
   - Sockets: Implement socket activation in Rust
   - Logging: Structured logs (tracing crate)

### Hands-On Exercise 5

**Build a Minimal SixOS-Rust Prototype:**

1. Fork SixOS repo
2. Add Rust supervisor as a package
3. Modify activation scripts to use Rust supervisor
4. Test with 3-5 real services (SSH, web server, database)
5. Validate:
   - Boot time
   - Dependency ordering
   - Restart behavior
   - Log quality

### Deliverable

**Artifact:** Design document titled "SixOS-Rust Hybrid Architecture"

Include:
- Component diagram
- Data flow
- Feature comparison (vs pure SixOS, vs systemd)
- Performance benchmarks
- Security analysis
- Migration path from NixOS

---

## Phase 5: Production Prototype & Validation (3-4 Weeks)

**Goal:** Build a production-worthy system and test at scale.

### Build Process

```bash
# Build bootable image
nix build .#sixos-rust-image

# Deploy to VM
./deploy-to-qemu.sh

# Or deploy to bare metal
dd if=result/image.img of=/dev/sda bs=4M
```

### Test Matrix

```clojure
{:test-scenarios
 {:boot-time
  ["Measure time from kernel handoff to services ready"
   "Compare with systemd, OpenRC, pure s6"
   "Target: < 5 seconds for minimal system"]
  
  :dependency-handling
  ["Complex DAG: 20 services with 50 edges"
   "Cyclic dependency detection"
   "Parallel startup optimization"]
  
  :failure-recovery
  ["Kill random services, verify restart"
   "Resource exhaustion (OOM, CPU)"
   "Cascading failures (db down, apps retry)"]
  
  :resource-usage
  ["Memory footprint of supervisor"
   "CPU overhead during steady state"
   "Disk I/O patterns"]
  
  :security
  ["Service isolation (user switching, namespaces)"
   "Log integrity (prevent tampering)"
   "Attack surface (compared to systemd)"]}}
```

### Real-World Stack

Deploy a complete application:

```clojure
{:production-stack
 ["PostgreSQL database"
  "Redis cache"
  "Backend API (Clojure/Ring)"
  "Frontend (Svelte via Node.js)"
  "Nginx reverse proxy"
  "Prometheus metrics"
  "Grafana dashboards"
  "Loki log aggregation"]}
```

Verify:
- All services start in correct order
- Logs are captured and queryable
- Metrics are collected
- Services restart on failure
- System survives node reboot

### Deliverable

**Artifact:** Production evaluation report

```markdown

# Conclusion: The Path Forward

```clojure
{:final-wisdom
 "This learning plan is not just about init systems.
  It's about mastering a way of thinking:
  
  1. Understand deeply (first principles)
  2. Experiment boldly (build prototypes)
  3. Measure rigorously (benchmark everything)
  4. Simplify ruthlessly (delete unnecessary complexity)
  5. Document thoroughly (teach others)
  6. Iterate relentlessly (version 1 is never the last)
  
  These are the principles that make SpaceX rockets land,
  that make xAI models converge,
  that make great engineers.
  
  Your journey from 9999 (Clojure/Nix ecosystem)
  through 9998 (this learning plan)
  down to 0000 (daily implementation)
  is the hero's journey in miniature:
  
  - Call to adventure: Why are init systems interesting?
  - Trials: Building, breaking, fixing, learning
  - Transformation: From student to contributor
  - Return: Teaching others what you've learned
  
  May your code be elegant, your tests be thorough,
  and your systems be reliable."}
 
 :from-the-i-ching
 "Hexagram 53: Gradual Progress (漸 Jiàn)
  
  'The wild goose gradually draws near the shore.
   The superior person improves their character through gradual progress.'
  
  Phase by phase, week by week, you ascend.
  Not by leaping, but by steady, deliberate steps.
  
  This is the way of mastery."}
