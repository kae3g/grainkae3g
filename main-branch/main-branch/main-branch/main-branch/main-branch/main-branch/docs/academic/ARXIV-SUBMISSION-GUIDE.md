# üåæ arXiv Submission Guide for Grain Network Paper

> **"From Graincards to Academic Recognition - The Path to Emergent Mind"**

## üìã **Executive Summary**

Based on web research, here's what you need to know about submitting to arXiv and getting featured on platforms like Emergent Mind:

### ‚úÖ **Good News**
- **No prestige required** - arXiv is open to independent researchers
- **No interviews** - Submission is purely online and automated
- **No sorting by credentials** - Papers judged on content, not author reputation
- **Automatic CDN distribution** - Once on arXiv, Emergent Mind automatically sources it
- **2.3M+ paper database** - Emergent Mind indexes all arXiv papers automatically

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Requirement: Endorsement**
- Most arXiv categories require **endorsement by an established researcher**
- This is the **primary barrier** for independent/first-time authors
- Once endorsed, you can submit papers freely in that category

---

## üéØ **Two Paths to arXiv Submission**

### **Path 1: Manual Web Submission** (Recommended for First Paper)
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Easier)  
**Timeline**: 1-3 days  
**Best for**: Getting initial endorsement, learning the system

#### **Steps**:
1. **Create arXiv Account**
   - Go to [arxiv.org/user/register](https://arxiv.org/user/register)
   - Provide email, affiliation (can be "Independent Researcher")
   - Verify email address

2. **Request Endorsement**
   - Choose category: **cs.DC** (Distributed Computing)
   - arXiv will prompt you to find an endorser
   - **Two ways to get endorsed**:
     - **Automatic**: If you have an email from a recognized institution (university, research lab)
     - **Manual**: Request endorsement from someone already endorsed in cs.DC

3. **Finding an Endorser** (If not automatic)
   - Look for researchers working on distributed systems, blockchain, or decentralized computing
   - Reach out via email with:
     - Brief introduction
     - Link to your work (kae3g.github.io/grainkae3g)
     - Abstract of your paper
     - Request for endorsement in cs.DC
   - Be polite, professional, and patient

4. **Submit Paper**
   - Upload LaTeX source files (`.tex`, `.bib`, figures)
   - arXiv compiles automatically
   - Add metadata (title, authors, abstract, categories)
   - Submit for moderation

5. **Wait for Approval**
   - arXiv moderators review (usually 24-48 hours)
   - Check for formatting issues, relevance, quality
   - Paper goes live on next arXiv announcement cycle

### **Path 2: API Submission** (For Bulk or Automated Submissions)
**Difficulty**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Advanced)  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks (setup) + submission time  
**Best for**: Ongoing research output, institutional use

#### **Steps**:
1. **Register API Client**
   - Go to [arXiv API Client Registry](https://arxiv.github.io/arxiv-submission-core/)
   - Apply for client credentials
   - Choose submission type:
     - **Proxy**: Submit on behalf of endorsed users
     - **Bulk**: Direct submission for large volumes

2. **Get Authorization Scopes**
   - **Proxy submission**: Requires `auth:3legged` + `submit:proxy`
   - **Bulk submission**: Requires `submit:bulk`
   - Implement OAuth 3-legged authorization

3. **Submit via API**
   ```bash
   # Create submission
   POST /submission/
   
   # Upload source package
   PUT /submission/{id}/source/
   
   # Add metadata
   PATCH /submission/{id}/metadata/
   
   # Finalize submission
   POST /submission/{id}/submit/
   ```

4. **Monitor Compilation**
   - arXiv compiles LaTeX to PDF
   - Check for errors
   - Fix and resubmit if needed

## üîë **Endorsement System Explained**

### **What is Endorsement?**
- **Purpose**: Quality control mechanism to prevent spam/low-quality submissions
- **Scope**: Category-specific (endorsement in cs.DC doesn't apply to physics)
- **One-time**: Once endorsed, you can submit freely in that category
- **No ongoing approval**: Each paper is moderated, but you don't need re-endorsement

### **Who Can Endorse?**
- Anyone who has submitted 2+ papers to the category
- Active researchers in the field
- Established members of the arXiv community

### **Automatic Endorsement**
You may receive automatic endorsement if:
- You have an email from a recognized institution
- You've published in peer-reviewed venues
- You're affiliated with a research organization

### **Manual Endorsement Request**
If not automatic:
1. Find potential endorsers via:
   - Search arXiv for papers in cs.DC (distributed computing)
   - Look for recent papers on blockchain, decentralized systems, P2P
   - Check author emails (usually in paper or institutional directory)

2. Email template:
   ```
   Subject: Endorsement Request for arXiv cs.DC Submission
   
   Dear [Professor/Dr. Name],
   
   I am reaching out to request your endorsement for submitting a paper 
   to arXiv in the cs.DC (Distributed Computing) category.
   
   I am an independent researcher working on decentralized astronomical 
   timestamp systems for multi-chain applications. My work focuses on 
   offline-first design and educational transparency in distributed systems.
   
   Paper title: "Graintime: A Decentralized Astronomical Timestamp System 
   with Offline Fallback for Multi-Chain Applications"
   
   You can view my ongoing work at: https://kae3g.github.io/grainkae3g/
   
   I have prepared the paper following arXiv guidelines and believe it 
   contributes to the distributed computing community. Would you be willing 
   to endorse me for submission to cs.DC?
   
   Thank you for considering my request.
   
   Best regards,
   [Your Name]
   ```

3. Be patient:
   - Researchers are busy
   - May take days or weeks for response
   - Consider reaching out to multiple people (politely)

## üìä **Emergent Mind Integration**

### **How Emergent Mind Works**
1. **Automatic Indexing**: Emergent Mind indexes **all arXiv papers** automatically
2. **No Submission Required**: Once your paper is on arXiv, it's in their database
3. **AI Research Assistant**: Their AI can synthesize and reference your work
4. **Trending Algorithm**: Papers surface based on:
   - Recency
   - Relevance to user queries
   - Citation patterns
   - Community engagement

### **Optimization for Visibility**
1. **Keywords**: Include in abstract and title:
   - "decentralized timestamp"
   - "offline-first design"
   - "multi-chain"
   - "educational transparency"
   - "astronomical calculations"

2. **Abstract Quality**: 
   - Lead with the problem (need for decentralized timestamps)
   - Highlight innovation (offline fallback, conservative algorithms)
   - Include quantitative results (¬±1-2 house accuracy)
   - Mention applications (ICP, Hedera, Solana)

3. **Category Selection**: 
   - **Primary**: cs.DC (Distributed Computing)
   - **Secondary**: cs.CY (Computers and Society) - for educational approach
   - **Tertiary**: cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) - for graincard10 UX

4. **Timing**: 
   - arXiv announcements go out daily
   - Submit Sunday-Thursday for next-day announcement
   - Friday-Saturday submissions announced Monday
