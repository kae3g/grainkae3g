# Grok 4 Prompt: SixOS Implementation and Framework 16 Integration

## Objective

Develop a comprehensive implementation plan for SixOS (NixOS without systemd) on Framework 16 laptops, focusing on practical installation, configuration, and daily workflow optimization.

## Context

**SixOS Overview:**
- NixOS variant without systemd (announced at 38C3, January 2025)
- Uses s6 supervision instead of systemd (200KB vs 1.5MB)
- "Infusion" paradigm - services managed like Nix packages
- Declarative configuration with atomic activation
- Owner-booted security (no unencrypted storage except EEPROM)

**Framework 16 Hardware:**
- AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS (8 cores, 16 threads)
- AMD Radeon 780M (RDNA 3) with open drivers
- 32GB DDR5-5600 RAM
- 1TB NVMe SSD
- 16" 2560x1600 165Hz display
- 4x USB-C ports with expansion cards

## Technical Requirements

### 1. SixOS Installation Process
- Create bootable SixOS ISO for Framework 16

- Hardware detection and driver configuration
- AMD GPU optimization with amdgpu driver

### 2. s6 Supervision System
- Replace systemd with s6 supervision tree
- Service directory structure (/etc/s6/sv/)
