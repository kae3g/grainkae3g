# Code Review as Spiritual Discipline
## Loving Attention to Others' Work

**Module:** Advanced 1 of 5  
**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Foundations 1-7, Some code review experience

---

## Overview

Code review is not mere error-checking. It is a practice of loving attention, clear seeing, and service to others. Done well, it elevates both reviewer and reviewed.

```clojure
(defn code-review-essence []
  "Beyond finding bugs"
  {:surface-level "Finding errors"
   :deeper-level "Understanding approach"
   :deepest-level "Supporting growth"})
```

---

## Why This Is Spiritual Practice

### It Requires Presence

You cannot review well while distracted. You must be fully present with the code and the author.

```clojure
(defn present-review [code author]
  "Full attention required"
  (-> (clear-your-mind)
      (focus-completely code)
      (see-author-intention author)
      (respond-from-wisdom)))
```

### It Cultivates Compassion

Seeing someone's work vulnerably shared calls forth compassion. You remember your own learning journey.

### It Practices Humility

You might be wrong. The author might have reasons you don't see. Approach with "beginner's mind."

### It Serves Others

Your careful attention helps someone grow. This is service without reward.

## The Three Phases of Review

### Phase 1: Preparation

Before looking at code:

```clojure
(def preparation-practice
  {:center-yourself
   {:action "Take three breaths"
    :intention "Clear mental clutter"
    :result "Present and ready"}
   
   :set-intention
   {:action "Remember purpose"
    :intention "Help, don't criticize"
    :result "Compassionate mindset"}
   
   :remember-humanity
   {:action "This is a learning person"
    :intention "Support their growth"
    :result "Patient approach"}})

(defn prepare-for-review []
  (-> (close-other-tabs)
      (breathe-three-times)
      (set-helpful-intention)
      (remember-author-is-learning)))
```

**Hebrew Wisdom:** "Prepare your heart" before important work.

**Ch'an Practice:** Clear mind before engaging.

### Phase 2: Examination

Reading the code with care:

```clojure
(def examination-practice
  {:first-read
   {:approach "Read all code first"
    :goal "Get overall sense"
    :resist "Commenting too early"}
   
   :understand-approach
   {:question "Why did they do this?"
    :seek "Author's reasoning"
    :before "Suggesting alternatives"}
   
   :find-strengths
   {:priority "Notice what works well"
    :purpose "Build on positives"
    :benefit "Encourage author"}
   
   :identify-concerns
   {:lens "Correctness, clarity, maintainability"
    :priority "Critical issues first"
    :context "Consider constraints"}})

(defn examine-code [code context]
  "Read with understanding, not judgment"
  (let [overview (read-completely code)
        approach (understand-why code context)
        strengths (find-what-works code)
        concerns (identify-issues code)]
    {:understanding-gained overview
     :authors-reasoning approach
     :positive-aspects strengths
     :improvement-areas concerns}))
```

**Talmudic Method:** Read thoroughly before commenting.

**Aristotelian:** Understand before evaluating.

### Phase 3: Response

Sharing your feedback:

```clojure
(def response-practice
  {:praise-first
   {:action "Comment on what works"
    :reason "Build confidence"
    :example "Excellent error handling here"}
   
   :question-gently
   {:action "Ask rather than tell"
    :reason "Preserve dignity"
    :example "Could we handle nil here?"
    :not "You forgot to handle nil"}
   
   :explain-why
   {:action "Give reasoning for suggestions"
    :reason "Teach, don't command"
    :example "This helps maintainability because..."}
   
   :offer-help
   {:action "Available for questions"
    :reason "Ongoing support"
    :example "Happy to pair on this if helpful"}})

(defn respond-with-care [code author findings]
  "Support growth, maintain dignity"
  (-> findings
      (start-with-praise)
      (suggest-not-demand)
      (explain-reasoning)
      (offer-continued-support author)))
```

**Gospel Teaching:** "Remove plank from own eye first"â€”review with humility.

**Confucian Ethics:** "Help others realize their best qualities."

## The Code Review as Dialogue

### Not: Superior to Inferior

```clojure
(def anti-pattern
  {:attitude "I am expert, you are learner"
   :tone "Commanding and critical"
   :result "Author feels diminished"})
```

### But: Peer to Peer

```clojure
(def healthy-pattern
  {:attitude "We are both learning"
   :tone "Curious and supportive"
   :result "Mutual growth"})
```

### Example Comments

**Anti-pattern:**
```
This is wrong. You should use map here.
Why didn't you add tests?
```

**Healthy pattern:**
```
I notice this could be simplified with map. What do you think?
[Q] Could we add a test for the edge case we discussed?
[Learning] This approach taught me about X! Thanks!
```

---

## Specific Practices

### The "Praise First" Rule

Always find something positive first. Always.

```clojure
(defn begin-review [code]
  (let [positive-aspects (find-strengths code)]
    (assert (seq positive-aspects)
            "Must find something good!")
    (comment-on positive-aspects)))
```

Even if it's just "Thanks for tackling this complex problem."

### The Question Method

Frame suggestions as questions when possible:

```clojure
(def suggestion-as-question
  {:instead-of "Change this to use reduce"
   :try "Could reduce work here? Might handle empty lists better"
   
   :instead-of "This variable name is unclear"
   :try "Would a more specific name help future readers?"
   
   :instead-of "Add error handling"
   :try "What should happen if the API call fails?"})
```

Questions invite thinking rather than demanding compliance.

### The "Share Learning" Technique

When you learn from their code, say so:

```clojure
(defn share-learning [code insight]
  "Make review mutual benefit"
  (comment-on code
    (str "TIL: " insight " from your approach here!")))
```

This transforms review from evaluation to dialogue.

### The "Offer Pairing" Option

For complex feedback:

```clojure
(defn complex-suggestion [issue]
  "Offer to work together"
  (str "This refactoring might take time. "
       "Happy to pair on it if that would help! "
       "Or I can push some suggestions if you prefer."))
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Bikeshedding

Focusing on trivial style issues instead of substance:

```clojure
(def bikeshedding
  {:symptom "Commenting on spacing, naming minutiae"
   :while-ignoring "Logic errors, architectural issues"
   :fix "Use linter for style, focus on substance"})
```

### Over-commenting

Every line doesn't need feedback:

```clojure
(def over-commenting
  {:symptom "Dozens of nitpicky comments"
   :impact "Author overwhelmed"
   :fix "Prioritize critical issues, group minor ones"})
```

### Under-commenting

Approving without real review:

```clojure
(def under-commenting
  {:symptom "Quick LGTM without reading"
   :impact "Bugs slip through, author unsupported"
   :fix "Block time for thorough review"})
```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### The "Compliment Sandwich" (Use Carefully)

```clojure
(def compliment-sandwich
  {:positive "Nice work on error handling!"
   :constructive "Could we add logging for debugging?"
   :positive "The test coverage is excellent!"
   
   :warning "Can feel manipulative if forced"
   :better "Genuine praise + honest feedback + support"})
```

### The "Alternative Approaches" Method

Instead of "This is wrong," show options:

```clojure
(defn suggest-alternatives [code]
  "Present options, let author choose"
  {:current-approach (describe code)
   :alternative-1 {:approach "..." :tradeoffs "..."}
   :alternative-2 {:approach "..." :tradeoffs "..."}
   :your-preference "I lean toward alternative-1 because..."
   :authors-choice "But you decide based on your constraints"})
```

### The "Teach Don't Tell" Approach

Link to resources:

```clojure
(defn teach-through-resources [concept]
  (str "This pattern is called " concept ". "
       "Here's a great article on it: [link]. "
       "Let me know if you want to discuss!"))
```

## Cultural Considerations

### Team Size Matters

```clojure
(def review-culture-by-size
  {:small-team {:style "Informal, conversational"
                :focus "Learning together"}
   :large-team {:style "More formal, documented"
                :focus "Standards and consistency"}})
```

### Remote vs Co-located

```clojure
(def remote-review-practices
  {:extra-care "Tone harder to read in text"
   :use-emoji "ðŸ˜Š to soften feedback"
   :be-explicit "State positive intent clearly"
   :offer-video "Complex issues: 'Want to videochat?'"})
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Self-Review First

Before your next code review, review your own PR as if you were someone else. Practice compassionate self-review.

### Exercise 2: Analyze Past Review

Look at a code review you gave. How did you do on:
- Praising first?
- Questioning gently?
- Explaining why?
- Offering help?

### Exercise 3: Receive Feedback Mindfully

Next time you receive review feedback, notice your emotional response. Practice receiving with gratitude, even critical feedback.

---

## Reflection Questions

1. Do you review code with same care you'd want for your code?
2. When do you feel defensive about feedback? Why?
3. How can you make review more about growth, less about gatekeeping?
4. What would change if you saw review as service?
5. Who has reviewed your code with exceptional care? What did they do?
