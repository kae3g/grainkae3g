# Multi-AI Prompt: Sway Alpine Linux Framework Laptop Segmentation Fault

## Context & Objective

We're experiencing a **segmentation fault** when starting Sway (Wayland compositor) on an **Alpine Linux Framework laptop 16** with **AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS w/ Radeon 780M Graphics**. The crash occurs during early initialization before any logs are generated, making debugging challenging.

**Goal**: Get Sway working with Wayland on Alpine Linux Framework laptop with musl libc purity.

## System Specifications

### Hardware
- **Laptop**: Framework 16 AMD
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS (16 cores, 8 physical, 2 threads per core)
- **GPU**: Radeon 780M Graphics (integrated)
- **Architecture**: x86_64
- **Memory**: 16GB+
- **Storage**: NVMe SSD

### Software Stack
- **OS**: Alpine Linux 6.12.51-0-lts (musl libc)
- **Init System**: s6 (musl-native process supervision)
- **Display Server**: Wayland (target)
- **Compositor**: Sway (i3-compatible Wayland compositor)
- **Package Manager**: apk
- **Shell**: ash (Alpine default)

### Current Status
- ✅ **Alpine Linux installed** and booting successfully
- ✅ **s6 init system** configured and working
- ✅ **Network connectivity** established (WiFi, DNS, internet)
- ✅ **SSH authentication** working for git operations
- ✅ **Package installation** working (apk commands successful)
- ❌ **Sway crashes with segmentation fault** during early initialization
- ❌ **No GUI environment** available

## The Problem

### Symptoms
1. **Sway crashes immediately** on startup with segmentation fault
2. **No log files generated** (crash happens before logging starts)
3. **Empty log commits** (system info captured, but no Sway logs)
4. **Early initialization crash** (before Wayland display creation)

### Error Evidence
- Commit messages show Sway logs should exist but files are empty/missing
- System info logs are captured successfully (3853 bytes each)
- No Sway, Wayland test, or dmesg logs in repository
- Segmentation fault occurs before any application logging begins

### Attempted Fixes
- ✅ **Package installation**: `sway`, `wayland`, `seatd`, `dbus`, `mesa-dri-gallium`, `mesa-vulkan-radeon`
- ✅ **Environment variables**: `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`
- ✅ **Service management**: seatd, dbus services
- ✅ **Permissions**: `/tmp` directory permissions, runtime directories
- ✅ **Hardware drivers**: Mesa drivers for AMD Radeon 780M
- ❌ **Still crashing** with segmentation fault
