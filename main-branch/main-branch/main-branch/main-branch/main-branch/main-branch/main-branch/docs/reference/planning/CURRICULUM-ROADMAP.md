# Rhizome Valley Curriculum Roadmap
## Immutable Series Architecture: 9500-9947 ‚Üí 9948-9960

**Vision**: Two complementary learning paths that converge at the **9948 checkpoint** ("Why We Love Computers").

**Three Wisdom Traditions**:
- üèõÔ∏è **Greek Philosophy** (Plato, Aristotle, Stoics) - Classical foundations
- üåô **Islamic Golden Age** (Al-Khwarizmi, Avicenna, House of Wisdom) - Medieval synthesis & preservation
- üíª **Modern Computing** (Turing, McCarthy, Hickey, Borcherds) - Contemporary application

**Through Plant-Based Lens**: Gardens, not factories. Cultivation, not construction. Living systems, not machines.

## üå≥ The Dual-Series Architecture

### Series A: The Structured Curriculum (9500-9947)
**~450 essays** | Systematic, building-block approach | Technical rigor + mathematical foundations

### Series B: The Narrative Chronicles (9948-9960) 
**13 essays** | Story-driven, character-based | Emotional engagement + quest structure

**Convergence Point**: Essay 9948 serves as the **bridge** between both paths.

## üéØ Design Principles for 9500s Series

1. **Immutability**: Once published, essays don't change (new essays supersede old ones)
2. **Small & Focused**: Each essay ~500-1500 words (vs 9948-9960's 2000-4000)
3. **Self-Contained**: Each essay stands alone (can be read in any order within phase)
4. **Cross-Referenced**: Heavy linking to related essays (graph structure, not just linear)
5. **Practical Exercises**: Every essay includes hands-on "Try This" section
6. **Mathematical Rigor**: Integrate Borcherds' Lie Groups framework throughout
7. **Ecological Metaphors**: Use Atthowe's permaculture wisdom consistently
8. **Code Examples**: Actual runnable code in every technical essay
9. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple intro ‚Üí intermediate detail ‚Üí advanced notes
10. **Tested**: All code examples must pass automated tests

## üìù Writing Guidelines for 9500s Series

### Structure
```markdown
# kae3g XXXX: Title (Verb + Concept)

**Phase X** | **Week Y** | **Reading Time: Z minutes**

## What You'll Learn
- 3-5 specific learning objectives

## Prerequisites
- Links to required prior essays
- Assumed knowledge

## The Core Concept
[500-800 words: main teaching]

## Mathematical Foundation
[200-400 words: if applicable]

## Hands-On Exercise
```clojure
;; Runnable code example
```

## Try This
- 3-5 practical exercises

## Going Deeper
- Links to related essays
- Advanced topics
- External resources

## Reflection Questions
- 2-3 questions for self-assessment

---
**Navigation**: ‚Üê Previous: [9XXX] | **Phase X Index** | Next: [9XXX] ‚Üí
```

### Tone
- **Clear**: Explain, don't assume
- **Friendly**: "We" and "you", not "one" or passive voice
- **Honest**: Admit complexity, don't oversimplify
- **Encouraging**: Celebrate small wins
- **Rigorous**: Cite sources, prove claims

---

## üîó Cross-Series Connections

Essays in the 9500s series should reference the narrative chronicles where appropriate:

- **9520 (FP basics)** ‚Üí See **9949** (Clojure as Functional Sage)
- **9660 (runit)** ‚Üí See **9956** (Training Grounds narrative)
- **9710 (Representations)** ‚Üí See **9951** (Orchestra metaphor)
- **9840 (Cosmopolitan)** ‚Üí See **9959** (Three Paths choice)
- **9901 (Grainhouse)** ‚Üí See **9960** (Full vision)

This creates a **web of meaning** rather than just linear paths.
