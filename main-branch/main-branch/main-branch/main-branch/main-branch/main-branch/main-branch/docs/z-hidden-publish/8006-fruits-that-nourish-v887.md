# Chapter 6: Fruits That Nourish

When a tree has grown tall and strong, when its roots run deep and its branches reach wide, it begins to bear fruit. These fruits are not kept for the tree alone—they fall to the ground, they are eaten by birds and animals, they nourish the soil, they feed the people. The tree gives its fruits with joy, knowing that this is why it grew in the first place.

The people who build this city understand this natural cycle. They know that when their work has grown strong and their skills have deepened, when their connections have spread wide and their roots run deep, it is time to bear fruit. It is time to share what they have learned, what they have created, what they have become.

Look at how nature shares its fruits. A fruit tree lets its apples and oranges fall when they are ripe, knowing that some will feed the hungry, some will carry seeds to new places, some will return to the earth to nourish the soil. The tree trusts that its fruits will serve their purpose, that they will find their way to where they are needed most.

This is how the city grows. Through people who have grown strong enough to bear fruit, who have learned enough to teach others, who have created enough to share with the community. These people understand that their greatest gift is what they give away with joy.

The gardeners tell a story about different trees and their journey to bearing fruit:

There was once a young apple tree that bloomed with beautiful flowers in spring, then spent the summer growing sweet, red apples that brought joy to children who picked them.

Nearby grew an ancient walnut tree that took many years to mature, but once it did, it produced rich, nourishing nuts that could be stored and shared throughout the winter months.

In the garden's center stood a cherry tree that flowered first with delicate pink blossoms, then bore small, sweet fruits that could be preserved as jam to spread joy all year long.

Each tree found its own way to nourish the community.

In the same way, every person in the city has their own fruits to bear. Some people naturally create beautiful things that inspire and delight others. Some people naturally solve problems and find solutions that help everyone. Some people naturally teach and share knowledge that helps others grow. Some people naturally care for those who are hurting and bring healing to the community.

When people remember this, when they see themselves as fruit-bearing trees, work becomes natural and generous. It becomes like the tree dropping its fruit—effortless, abundant, and deeply satisfying. People find themselves giving with joy of their gifts, sharing what they have learned, offering what they have created, knowing that this is why they grew in the first place.

The city grows when people bear fruit. When they share their knowledge and skills with others. When they create beautiful things that bring joy to the community. When they solve problems that help everyone. When they teach and guide those who are just beginning to grow.

This is the beauty of the fruit-bearing cycle. It creates abundance where there was scarcity, knowledge where there was confusion, beauty where there was emptiness. When one person shares their fruits with joy, others are inspired to share theirs as well. The giving creates a ripple effect, spreading nourishment and joy throughout the community.

The city is here. It has always been here. It is waiting for people to remember that they are fruit-bearing trees, that they have gifts to share, that their greatest joy comes from nourishing others. When they remember this, when they bear fruit with joy, when they share what they have become, the city grows. Naturally. Abundantly. Generously.
