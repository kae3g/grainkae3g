## üõ†Ô∏è **Part 1: Shell Configuration with grainzsh**

### **What is Grainzsh?**

Grainzsh is a minimalist shell configuration system that gives you:
- A clean `Œª` (lambda) prompt
- Useful aliases for common tasks
- Integration with Grain Network tools
- Fast startup time (~50ms)

### **Hands-On: Install grainzsh**

```bash
# Step 1: Navigate to grainzsh
cd ~/kae3g/grainkae3g/grainstore/grainzsh

# Step 2: Look at the template
cat template/.zshrc

# Step 3: Install (creates symlink)
ln -sf $PWD/template/.zshrc ~/.zshrc

# Step 4: Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc

# Step 5: See your new prompt!
Œª 
```

### **Understanding the Lambda Prompt**

**Q**: Why use `Œª` (lambda) as a prompt?

**A**: Lambda represents:
- **Simplicity**: Just one character, no clutter
- **Speed**: Instant rendering
- **Functional Programming**: Mathematical elegance
- **Universality**: Recognized across programming communities

Compare:
```bash
# Complicated prompt (slow, cluttered)
[user@hostname ~/very/long/path] (git:main*) $

# Lambda prompt (fast, clean)
Œª
```

### **Activity 1: Customize Your Prompt**

**Easy Mode**: Use the template as-is
```bash
Œª echo "I'm using grainzsh!"
```

**Advanced Mode**: Create personal config
```bash
# Copy template
cp template/.zshrc personal/YOURNAME/.zshrc

# Add your customization
nano personal/YOURNAME/.zshrc

# Example: Add emoji
PROMPT='üåæ Œª '

# Or add color
PROMPT='%F{green}Œª%f '
```

### **Useful Aliases Included**

```bash
Œª gb                    # Grainbarrel build system
Œª gs                    # git status (quick check)
Œª ga .                  # git add all
Œª gc -m "message"       # git commit
Œª grain grainbarrel     # Jump to module
Œª grain-session         # Create session document
```

### **Discussion Questions**
1. What makes a good shell prompt? Why does minimalism matter?
2. How do aliases improve your productivity?
3. Why separate template from personal configuration?

---

## üîí **Part 2: Secure Environment Variables with grainenvvars**

### **What Are Environment Variables?**

Environment variables are system-wide settings that programs can read.

**Example**:
```bash
# Check your home directory
Œª echo $HOME
/home/yourname

# Check your shell
Œª echo $SHELL
/usr/bin/zsh
```

### **Why Use Environment Variables for API Keys?**

**Bad Practice** ‚ùå:
```clojure
;; Hardcoded API key in code (NEVER DO THIS!)
(def api-key "sk-proj-abc123xyz...")

;; Now your secret is in git history forever!
```

**Good Practice** ‚úÖ:
```clojure
;; Load from environment variable
(def api-key (System/getenv "OPENAI_API_KEY"))

;; Secret stays out of code and git
```

### **Hands-On: Set Up grainenvvars**

**Step 1: Copy the template**
```bash
cd ~/kae3g/grainkae3g/grainstore/grainenvvars

# Copy template as starting point
cp template/env.template personal/.env
```

**Step 2: Add a test API key**
```bash
# Edit personal/.env
nano personal/.env

# Add (use FAKE key for learning!):
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-test-FAKE-KEY-FOR-LEARNING-ONLY
MY_NAME=YourName
MY_FAVORITE_COLOR=blue
```

**Step 3: Load in your shell**
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc:
export $(cat ~/kae3g/grainkae3g/grainstore/grainenvvars/personal/.env | grep -v '^#' | xargs)

# Reload
source ~/.zshrc

# Test it worked
Œª echo $MY_NAME
YourName
```

### **Important Security Rules**

**NEVER** ‚ùå:
- Commit secrets to git
- Share API keys in chat/email
- Use the same key everywhere
- Store private keys in environment variables

**ALWAYS** ‚úÖ:
- Use a password manager (1Password, Bitwarden)
- Keep personal/.env in .gitignore
- Rotate keys every 90 days
- Use separate keys for development and production

### **Activity 2: Check Your .gitignore**

```bash
# Navigate to grainenvvars
cd ~/kae3g/grainkae3g/grainstore/grainenvvars

# Check .gitignore contains personal/.env
cat .gitignore | grep "personal/.env"

# Verify git ignores it
git status

# You should NOT see personal/.env listed!
```

**Discussion**: What happens if you accidentally commit an API key? How would you fix it?

---

## üîê **Part 3: Password Manager Integration**

### **What is 1Password?**

1Password is a password manager that:
- Stores all your passwords encrypted
- Syncs across devices
- Has a command-line interface (CLI)
- Provides audit trails

### **Why Use a Password Manager?**

**Without Password Manager** ‚ùå:
- Write passwords in notebook (lost/stolen)
- Reuse same password (one breach = all compromised)
- Store in browser (not encrypted)
- Keep in plain text files (dangerous!)

**With Password Manager** ‚úÖ:
- One master password (memorize only this)
- Unique password for every service
- Encrypted vault (even provider can't read it)
- Audit trail (know when accessed)

### **1Password CLI Demo**

```bash
# Install 1Password CLI
# (Teacher demonstrates, students observe)

# Sign in
op signin

# Store a secret
op item create \
    --category=login \
    --title="My Test API Key" \
    password="test-key-123"

# Retrieve it
op item get "My Test API Key" --fields password

# Load into environment
export MY_API_KEY=$(op item get "My Test API Key" --fields password)
```

### **Activity 3: Design Your Security System**

**Scenario**: You're building an app that needs:
- OpenAI API key (for AI features)
- Database password (for storing data)
- Email SMTP password (for sending emails)

**Questions to Answer**:
1. Where will you store each secret?
2. How will your code access them?
3. What happens if your laptop is stolen?
4. How will you share with a teammate?

**Discuss**: Template vs. personal split for security

## üå± **Part 4: The Grain Alternative Protein Project**

### **Connecting Technology and Sustainability**

**Question**: What does a tech project have to do with food?

**Answer**: **Everything is connected!**

- Technology uses electricity (environmental impact)
- Developers need to eat (food choices matter)
- Computing resources could feed people (priorities)
- Open-source values apply to food systems too

### **What is the Alt Protein Project?**

Inspired by [The Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org/the-alt-protein-project/), the Alt Protein Project:
- Educates about plant-based nutrition
- Advocates for sustainable food systems
- Researches alternative proteins
- Builds student-led chapters at universities

**Chapters exist at**:
- Stanford University
- UC Davis
- Johns Hopkins
- Duke University
- Brown University
- ETH Z√ºrich
- University of Illinois (Jenna's school!)
- And many more!

### **Why Plant-Based Matters**

**Environmental Impact**:
- üåä **Water**: Animal agriculture uses 70% of freshwater
- üåç **Land**: 77% of agricultural land for only 18% of calories
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Emissions**: 14.5% of global greenhouse gases
- üå≤ **Forests**: Leading cause of deforestation

**Health Impact**:
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Heart Disease**: Lower risk with plant-based diet
- ü©∫ **Chronic Disease**: Reduced diabetes, cancer risk
- üí™ **Athletic Performance**: Elite athletes thrive on plants
- üß† **Longevity**: Blue zones eat mostly plants

**Economic Impact**:
- üí∞ **Cost**: Beans and grains cheaper than meat
- üåæ **Efficiency**: 10x more people fed with same resources
- üöú **Farming**: Sustainable agriculture creates jobs
- üíö **Healthcare**: Reduced medical costs

### **Grain Network Connection**

**grainaltproteinproject** integrates with:
- **Grainmusic**: Fundraising concerts for food justice
- **Grainweb**: Educational resource hub
- **Graindroid**: Nutrition tracking app
- **Grainframe**: Visual educational materials (80x110)
- **ICP/Solana**: Decentralized funding for chapters

### **Activity 4: Calculate Your Impact**

**Weekly Meal Log**:
Track one week of meals. For each meal, mark:
- üå± Plant-based (beans, grains, vegetables, fruits)
- ü•© Animal-based (meat, dairy, eggs)
- ü•§ Beverages

**Calculate Environmental Savings**:
```
One plant-based meal saves approximately:
- 200 gallons of water
- 20 pounds of CO2 emissions  
- 30 square feet of land

If you eat 21 meals per week:
- 10 plant-based meals = 2,000 gallons water saved
- 15 plant-based meals = 3,000 gallons + 300 lbs CO2
```

**Discussion**:
- What surprised you about the numbers?
- What barriers exist to eating more plant-based?
- How could technology help?

### **How They Work Together**

1. **You open your terminal** ‚Üí grainzsh loads
2. **grainzsh loads grainenvvars** ‚Üí Environment variables set
3. **You type `gb grainstore:validate`** ‚Üí grainbarrel runs
4. **grainbarrel accesses environment** ‚Üí Uses your API keys securely
5. **Tasks execute** ‚Üí Your work gets done!

### **Activity 5: Build Your Own Stack**

**Challenge**: Create your own mini-stack

```bash
# 1. Create your shell config
echo 'PROMPT="üåæ Œª "' > ~/.zshrc.custom

# 2. Add environment variable
echo 'export MY_PROJECT_NAME="MyCoolProject"' >> ~/.zshrc.custom

# 3. Add useful alias
echo 'alias proj="cd ~/projects/mycoolproject"' >> ~/.zshrc.custom

# 4. Source and test
source ~/.zshrc.custom

# 5. Use your customizations
Œª echo $MY_PROJECT_NAME
Œª proj
```

---

## üìñ **Part 6: Template/Personal Split Pattern**

### **The Problem**

You're working on a group project. Everyone needs:
- Same basic configuration (linting rules, build scripts)
- Different personal settings (API keys, local paths)

How do you share the first without exposing the second?

### **The Solution: Template/Personal Split**

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ template/              ‚Üê Commit to git (shared)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .zshrc             ‚Üê Shell template
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ env.template       ‚Üê Environment template
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.edn       ‚Üê Build settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ personal/              ‚Üê NEVER commit (private)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env               ‚Üê Your real API keys
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ local-config.edn   ‚Üê Your preferences
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitkeep           ‚Üê Keep directory in git
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore             ‚Üê Ignore personal/*
```

### **Hands-On: Implement the Pattern**

**Step 1**: Create structure
```bash
mkdir -p myproject/template myproject/personal
cd myproject
```

**Step 2**: Add template
```bash
# template/config.txt
APP_NAME=MyAwesomeApp
API_ENDPOINT=https://api.example.com
```

**Step 3**: Add personal (with fake values for learning!)
```bash
# personal/secrets.txt
API_KEY=test-key-for-learning-only
USERNAME=student_name
```

**Step 4**: Create .gitignore
```bash
# .gitignore
personal/secrets.txt
personal/*.env
```

**Step 5**: Test git
```bash
git init
git add .
git status

# You should see:
# - template/config.txt (will be committed)
# - .gitignore (will be committed)
# - personal/ directory structure (will be committed)
# - personal/secrets.txt (IGNORED - won't be committed)
```

### **Why This Matters**

- **Collaboration**: Share best practices without exposing secrets
- **Security**: Secrets never accidentally committed
- **Flexibility**: Everyone customizes to their needs
- **Education**: Teach patterns that scale to real projects

## üåæ **Part 7: Sustainable Food Systems**

### **The Challenge**

Current food system problems:
- üåç **Climate**: Agriculture = 25% of emissions
- üíß **Water**: Massive waste in animal agriculture
- üå≤ **Land**: Deforestation for grazing/feed
- üí∞ **Economics**: Inefficient use of resources
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Justice**: Food deserts and inequitable access

### **The Solution**

**Alternative Proteins**:
- **Plant-Based**: Whole foods (beans, grains, nuts)
- **Fermented**: Tempeh, miso, nutritional yeast
- **Cultivated**: Lab-grown meat (future)
- **Precision Fermentation**: Animal proteins without animals

### **Grain Alternative Protein Project**

**Mission**: Empower students to advocate for sustainable food systems

**What We Do**:
1. **Education**: Plant-based nutrition workshops
2. **Advocacy**: Campus dining changes
3. **Research**: Alternative protein technologies
4. **Community**: Build networks of changemakers

**How It Connects to Tech**:
- **Grainweb**: Resource hub and community platform
- **Graindroid**: Nutrition tracking and meal planning app
- **Grainframe**: Educational visual materials
- **ICP/Solana**: Decentralized funding for chapters
- **Open Source**: Share knowledge freely

### **Activity 6: Design a Solution**

**Challenge**: Create an app to help people eat more plant-based meals

**Requirements**:
1. Recipe database (easy, delicious recipes)
2. Nutrition tracker (ensure complete protein)
3. Environmental impact calculator (show water/CO2 saved)
4. Community features (share recipes, tips)

**Questions to Answer**:
- What features are most important?
- How would you make it accessible to everyone?
- How does template/personal split apply?
- What API keys would you need?

**Design on Paper**:
- Sketch the app interface
- List the features
- Identify data sources (where do recipes come from?)
- Plan the security (where are API keys stored?)

---

## üéì **Part 8: Real-World Application**

### **Case Study: Building a Grain Network Tool**

**Scenario**: You want to build a tool that:
1. Uses OpenAI API to generate recipes
2. Stores favorites in a database
3. Shares with friends via ICP
4. Deploys to Grainweb

**Implementation**:

```clojure
;; 1. Load environment variables (grainenvvars)
(def openai-key (System/getenv "OPENAI_API_KEY"))

;; 2. Use in your code
(defn generate-recipe [ingredients]
  (when openai-key
    (call-openai-api openai-key ingredients)))

;; 3. Deploy with gb (grainbarrel)
;; $ gb myapp:deploy

;; 4. Share via ICP (grainweb)
(defn share-recipe [recipe]
  (icp-publish recipe))
```

**Security Checklist**:
- [ ] API key in grainenvvars/personal/.env
- [ ] personal/.env in .gitignore
- [ ] Real key stored in 1Password
- [ ] Development key separate from production
- [ ] Code uses environment variables (not hardcoded)

### **Activity 7: Build Your First Secure Tool**

**Assignment**: Create a script that uses an environment variable

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bb
;; my-tool.bb

(ns my-tool)

(defn -main []
  (let [name (or (System/getenv "MY_NAME") "Student")]
    (println (str "Hello, " name "!"))
    (println "üåæ Welcome to the Grain Network")))

(-main)
```

**Test It**:
```bash
# Without environment variable
Œª bb my-tool.bb
Hello, Student!

# With environment variable
Œª MY_NAME="Alice" bb my-tool.bb
Hello, Alice!

# With grainenvvars loaded
Œª bb my-tool.bb
Hello, YourName!
```

### **Common Questions**

**Q**: "Why learn about food in a coding class?"  
**A**: Everything is connected! Computing uses resources, developers eat food, technology can solve real problems. Plus, systems thinking applies everywhere.

**Q**: "Isn't plant-based eating expensive?"  
**A**: Beans, rice, and lentils are the cheapest foods! Whole plant foods cost less than meat.

**Q**: "Do I have to go 100% plant-based?"  
**A**: No! Any reduction helps. Start with Meatless Monday or plant-based breakfast. Progress over perfection.

**Q**: "What if I mess up and commit my API key?"  
**A**: Great question! That's why we practice with fake keys first. In real life, you'd immediately rotate the key and use git filter-branch to remove it from history.
