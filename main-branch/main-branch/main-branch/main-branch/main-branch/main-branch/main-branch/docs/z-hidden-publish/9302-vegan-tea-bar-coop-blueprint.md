## The Vision: A Living Laboratory

*We stand in an empty storefront in downtown Sacramento, sunlight streaming through large windows. The space is perfect: 2,500 square feet of open floor plan, high ceilings, exposed brick walls, and a kitchen that once served a failed restaurant.*

*"This," says the Community Architect, "is where we build the future. Not just an herbal bar, but a living laboratory for how technology can serve community, how herbs can be medicine, and how business can be a force for good—all without the jittery energy of caffeine."*

*She spreads out blueprints across a reclaimed wood table—not just architectural plans, but social blueprints, economic blueprints, and technological blueprints all woven together.*
