# Start Here: Documentation Pipeline Guide

Welcome to the Documentation Pipeline! This system
helps you create beautiful, professional documentation
websites from simple markdown files.

## What Is This Project?

This is a **documentation build pipeline** that
transforms markdown documents into beautiful compiled
websites using:

- **Babashka** (fast Clojure scripting)
- **Svelte** (reactive web components)
- **Nix** (reproducible builds)
- **57-Character Lines** (readable formatting)
- **Automated Processing** (one command builds)

Whether you're documenting software, creating technical
guides, or building a knowledge base, this pipeline
makes it simple and professional.

```

## Project Philosophy

This pipeline is designed with these principles:

- **Simplicity** - Easy to use and understand
- **Quality** - Professional output every time
- **Speed** - Fast builds with Babashka
- **Standards** - Consistent 57-char formatting
- **Automation** - Build, validate, deploy easily

## For Beginners

If you're new to documentation pipelines or coding:

1. Read [Basic Concepts](01-getting-started/CONCEPTS.md)
2. Follow [Quick Start](01-getting-started/QUICK-START.md)
3. Type commands exactly as shown
4. Watch the results! âœ¨
5. Learn by doing, one step at a time

Don't worry if you don't understand everything at
first. The guides explain each concept clearly.
