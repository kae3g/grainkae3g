## 🌅 **The Solar House Clock: A Revolutionary Approach**

### **Traditional vs. Solar House Systems**

**Traditional Natal Chart Houses:**
- Based on birth time and location
- Ascendant (1st house) = rising sign at birth
- Houses remain fixed for life
- Used for personality analysis and life predictions

**Solar House Clock System:**
- Based on **current time** and **Sun's position**
- **1st House** = Sunrise (ascendant)
- **10th House** = Solar Noon (midheaven)
- **7th House** = Sunset (descendant)
- **4th House** = Solar Midnight (imum coeli)
- Houses change throughout the day
- Used for **real-time astrological guidance**

### **The Four Cardinal Points**

```
        Sunrise (1st House)
              ↑
              |
Midnight (4th) ← → Solar Noon (10th)
              |
              ↓
        Sunset (7th House)
```

**Morning Houses (1st → 10th):**
- **1st House**: Sunrise - New beginnings, identity, physical body
- **2nd House**: Early morning - Resources, values, possessions
- **3rd House**: Mid-morning - Communication, siblings, short journeys
- **11th House**: Late morning - Friends, hopes, social networks
- **10th House**: Solar Noon - Career, reputation, public image

**Afternoon Houses (10th → 7th):**
- **9th House**: Early afternoon - Higher learning, philosophy, travel
- **8th House**: Mid-afternoon - Transformation, shared resources, mysteries
- **7th House**: Sunset - Partnerships, marriage, open enemies

**Evening Houses (7th → 4th):**
- **6th House**: Early evening - Health, service, daily routines
- **5th House**: Mid-evening - Creativity, children, romance, speculation
- **4th House**: Solar Midnight - Home, family, roots, private life

**Night Houses (4th → 1st):**
- **3rd House**: Late night - Communication, siblings, short journeys
- **2nd House**: Pre-dawn - Resources, values, possessions
- **1st House**: Sunrise - New beginnings, identity, physical body

sudo apt install libswe-dev

# Install Babashka
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babashka/babashka/master/install | bash
```

### **Step 2: Create Basic Graintime Function**

```clojure
(ns my-graintime
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]))

(defn simple-graintime
  "Create a simple graintime timestamp"
  [author]
  (let [now (java.time.ZonedDateTime/now)
        year (+ (.getYear now) 10000)
        month (.getMonthValue now)
        day (.getDayOfMonth now)
        hour (.getHour now)
        minute (.getMinute now)]
    (format "%d-%02d-%02d--%02d%02d--%s"
            year month day hour minute author)))

;; Test it
(simple-graintime "student")
;; => "12025-10-22--2105--student"
```

### **Step 3: Add Solar House Calculation**

```clojure
(defn calculate-simple-house
  "Calculate house based on time of day"
  [hour]
  (let [house (cond
                (<= 6 hour 8) 1   ; Sunrise
                (<= 8 hour 10) 2  ; Early morning
                (<= 10 hour 12) 3 ; Mid-morning
                (<= 12 hour 14) 10; Solar noon
                (<= 14 hour 16) 11; Early afternoon
                (<= 16 hour 18) 9 ; Mid-afternoon
                (<= 18 hour 20) 7 ; Sunset
                (<= 20 hour 22) 6 ; Early evening
                (<= 22 hour 24) 5 ; Late evening
                (<= 0 hour 2) 4   ; Midnight
                (<= 2 hour 4) 3   ; Late night
                (<= 4 hour 6) 2   ; Pre-dawn
                :else 1)]
    house))

(defn enhanced-graintime
  "Create graintime with solar house"
  [author]
  (let [now (java.time.ZonedDateTime/now)
        year (+ (.getYear now) 10000)
        month (.getMonthValue now)
        day (.getDayOfMonth now)
        hour (.getHour now)
        minute (.getMinute now)
        house (calculate-simple-house hour)]
    (format "%d-%02d-%02d--%02d%02d--sun-%02dthhouse--%s"
            year month day hour minute house author)))

;; Test it
(enhanced-graintime "student")
;; => "12025-10-22--2105--sun-06thhouse--student"
```
