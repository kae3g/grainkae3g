  "author": "YourName",
  "description": "My personal sovereignty computing journey",
  "githubUrl": "https://github.com/yourname/grainkae3g",
  "email": "your@email.com"
}
```

---

## üåê Step 3: Deploy Your Website

### GitHub Pages (Free Hosting)

**Option 1: Using Existing Build**

```bash
# Build the website
cd web-app
npm install
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
cd ..
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial customization"
git push origin main

# Enable GitHub Pages in Settings
# Go to: Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Source ‚Üí main branch ‚Üí /docs folder
```

**Option 2: Using GitHub Actions**

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      working-directory: ./web-app
      run: npm install
    
    - name: Build
      working-directory: ./web-app
      run: npm run build
    
    - name: Deploy
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./web-app/build
```

**Your site will be live at:**
```
https://yourname.github.io/grainkae3g/
```

---

## üé® Step 4: Customize Design & Content

### Change Color Scheme

**In `web-app/src/styles/theme.css`:**

```css
:root {
  /* Original Grain colors */
  --grain-primary: #4a7c59;
  --grain-accent: #f4a261;
  
  /* Change to your colors */
  --grain-primary: #your-color;
  --grain-accent: #your-accent;
}
```

**Using Cursor AI:**
1. Open `theme.css`
2. Press Cmd+K
3. Prompt: "Change the color scheme to use blue and orange"
4. Review suggestions and accept

### Add Your Own Content

**Create Your First Article:**

```bash
# In Cursor, create new file
mkdir -p data/articles
touch data/articles/my-first-project.md
```

**In `my-first-project.md`:**
```markdown
---
title: "My First Grain Network Project"
date: 2025-01-22
author: YourName
tags: ["learning", "grain-network", "tutorial"]
---

# My First Grain Network Project

Today I started my journey into personal sovereignty computing...

[Write about your project]
```

**Add to `data/magazine-content.edn`:**
```clojure
{:articles
 [{:id "my-first-project"
   :title "My First Grain Network Project"
   :author "YourName"
   :date "2025-01-22"
   :file "articles/my-first-project.md"}]}
```

---

## üîß Step 5: Customize for Your Hardware

### Document Your Own Projects

**Create hardware documentation:**

```bash
# Create directory for your hardware projects
mkdir -p docs/hardware/my-projects
```

**Example: Document Your Own Camera Project**

**Inspired by:** Graincamera  
**My Approach:** Using Raspberry Pi instead of RISC-V  
**Budget:** $200  
**Timeline:** 3 months

**Components:**

- 3D-printed enclosure - $10
- [etc...]

**Build Log:**
[Document your progress]
```

### Create Your Own Course Module

**Add to the course:**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/course/my-modules
```
