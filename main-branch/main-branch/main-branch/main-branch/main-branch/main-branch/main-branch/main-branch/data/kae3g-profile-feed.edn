   :title "Our Origin Is Not Here"
   :content "This phrase resonates deeply with the journey of building a personal sovereignty stack. It speaks to a sense of displacement from conventional systems and a yearning for a more authentic, self-determined digital existence.

It implies:
- A rejection of centralized control: Our digital 'origin' is not in the hands of corporations or monolithic platforms
- A search for true roots: We are seeking a foundation that aligns with our values, perhaps in decentralized networks, open-source principles, or self-hosted infrastructure
- A philosophical stance: Our true potential, our 'origin,' lies beyond the current limitations and compromises of the mainstream tech landscape

This serves as a reminder of the core motivation: to forge a new path, to build a system where our digital selves are truly our own, and where our 'origin' is defined by our own choices and creations, not by external forces."

   :title "Introducing Grainsource - Our Git Abstraction"
   :content "Perfect name for our Git abstraction! Why 'Grainsource' is better than all alternatives:

- Source - Direct reference to source code/version control
- Grain + Source - 'Source of grains' = repository of atomic commits
- Open Source - Perfect alignment with our open-source philosophy
- Single source of truth - Each grainsource is the authoritative version

Command Structure:
```bash
grainsource init          # Initialize new repository
grainsource harvest       # Clone/download repository
grainsource plant         # Commit changes
grainsource share         # Push to remote
grainsource gather        # Pull from remote
grainsource sync          # Bidirectional sync (like Urbit sync)
```

Technical Architecture:
- Backend: Git-compatible core (libgit2 bindings via Clojure)
- Frontend: Clojure Humble UI desktop app
- Sync: Works with GitHub, Codeberg, self-hosted Git
- Extensions: ICP canister storage, Urbit sync integration, Solana commit signatures
- s6 Integration: clojure-s6 daemon for background sync
- SixOS Native: First-class citizen on SixOS

This is it. Grainsource = our Git."

   :content "Complete open-source hardware platform for personal sovereignty:

Devices:
- Graincamera - Open-hardware mirrorless camera with native AVIF support, RISC-V processor, Fujifilm X-mount, Nostr + ICP integration ($799)
- Grainwriter - E-ink writing device with 64GB RAM-only storage, infinite battery life, IP68 waterproof, MIL-STD-810H rugged, SixOS + Clojure ($1,099-$1,699)
- Grainpack - External GPU attachment for Grainwriter with refurbished AMD GPUs, IP68 waterproof, hot-swappable USB-C connection ($1,199-$1,699)

Agentic Pipeline:
- Self-hosted AI development with Void/Zed editors
- Open-source models: Qwen3, Gemini, Llama, GPT-OS
- GPU-accelerated via Grainpack
- Complete privacy - code never leaves your infrastructure

Design Principles:
- Radical repairability (screws-only, no glue)
- User upgradeability (RAM, batteries, GPU)
- Open firmware (Coreboot + SixOS)
- Sustainable materials (refurbished, recyclable)
- Lifetime design (10+ year lifespan)
- Privacy first (no telemetry, no cloud lock-in)

Status: Design phase complete ✅ | Prototype phase next (2025 Q2) | Production planned (2025 Q4)"

   :title "iPod Touch - Steve Jobs' Best Invention"
   :content "The iPod Touch was Steve Jobs' best invention - a perfect balance of simplicity, functionality, and user experience. It demonstrated how a device could be both powerful and intuitive, offline-capable yet syncable, and completely focused on its core purpose without unnecessary complexity.

Inspiration for Grainwriter: The iPod Touch's philosophy of 'sync when connected, work when offline' is exactly what we're building with the Grainwriter - a device that works perfectly in isolation but syncs beautifully when you want to share your work.

Key Principles:
- Offline-first design
- Simple, focused interface
- Manual sync when needed
- No unnecessary connectivity
- Perfect for its intended purpose"

   :content "Comprehensive Clojure library for Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) integration.

Purpose:
- Low-level IC agent for canister communication
- Candid type system encode/decode
- Identity and principal management
- High-level canister client abstractions
- Chain Fusion multi-chain integration
- Subnet management and queries

Integration:
- Grainspace - Identity management
- Graincamera - Photo storage in ICP canisters
- Grainwriter - Document sync to ICP storage
- Grainpack - GPU compute on ICP subnets
- clojure-photos - Uses clojure-icp for photo storage

Key Features:
- IC Agent Interface (call, query)
- Candid type system
- Identity management (generate, from PEM, sign)
- Canister deployment and management
- Chain Fusion (Solana, Ethereum)
- Subnet queries
