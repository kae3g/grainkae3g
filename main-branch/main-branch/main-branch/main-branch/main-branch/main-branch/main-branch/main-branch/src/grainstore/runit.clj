  "runit process supervision - Clojure implementation of crash-only design.
  
  See:
  - grainstore/specs/runit.nock.md - Mathematical specification
  - test/grainstore/runit_test.clj - Test suite (42 assertions)
  
  This implementation follows the Nock spec exactly:
  - TWO-state machine (down, up) - simpler than s6!
  - IMMEDIATE kill (SIGKILL, not SIGTERM)
  - INSTANT restart (no delays)
  - NO state persistence between restarts
  - Crash-only semantics (embrace failure)"
