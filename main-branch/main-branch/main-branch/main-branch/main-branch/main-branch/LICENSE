üåæ Grain Network Philosophy:

This software is part of the Grain Network - a sovereign, multi-chain, 
append-only system for building next-generation distributed applications.

The Grain Network is built on principles of:
- Local Control, Global Intent
- Purpose-Built Over Generic
- Declarative Over Imperative
- Template/Personal Everywhere
- Real Resources Matter
- Pragmatic Branding
- Temporal Recursion (now == next + 1)
