We live in an age where the word \"conservative\" has been twisted to mean merely opposing the latest fashion, when it should mean what it has always meant: <em>conservare</em>—to keep, to preserve, to tend carefully what has been entrusted to us.</p><p>I write as one who believes that biblical stewardship extends to all of creation—that the God who numbers the hairs on our heads also sees the sparrow that falls, and that our dominion over the earth is not license for cruelty but responsibility for care. This is not a new doctrine but an ancient one, held by the Church Fathers, articulated by the Reformers, and practiced by the faithful farmers who have always known that good husbandry is holy work.</p><p>What follows is neither manifesto nor prescription but rather an offering—a vision of what Idaho's future might hold if we build upon our strengths: agricultural heritage, manufacturing capacity, family values, and the fierce independence that has always characterized this place where mountains meet plains.</p><p>Let us reason together, as the prophet Isaiah invited. Let us consider how farming and manufacturing, properly ordered toward the common good and the glory of God, might provide livelihood for our children and grandchildren while honoring the land He has given us.<h2></h2></p><h2>Part I: On the Nature of True Conservatism and Biblical Stewardship</h2><h3>What We Seek to Conserve</h3><p>The modern conservative often finds himself in the curious position of defending that which scarcely exists anymore. We speak of \"traditional values\" in a nation barely two centuries old. We praise \"free enterprise\" while watching small businesses crushed by regulations designed by and for large corporations. We champion \"family farms\" even as they disappear beneath the tide of industrial agriculture.</p><p>But what if we stepped back further? What if we asked not what <em>America</em> traditionally was, but what <em>Creation</em> was intended to be?</p><p>The book of Genesis—which both the learned theologian and the simple farmer can read with profit—presents us with a vision: Man placed in a garden, given the task of tending and keeping it. Not exploiting it. Not maximizing quarterly returns from it. <em>Tending and keeping</em>. The Hebrew words are <em>abad</em> (to serve, to work) and <em>shamar</em> (to keep, to guard, to preserve).</p><p>This is the original conservative mandate: to serve the land and guard it, to work it and preserve it, to take from it in a manner that allows it to give again, generation after generation.</p><p>When the Israelites were given the law, they were commanded to let the land rest every seventh year. Not for sentimental reasons, but because the land, like the laborer, requires Sabbath. Modern agronomic science has confirmed what ancient wisdom knew: soil depleted year after year without rest becomes barren. The commandment was not merely moral but practical—God's laws for creation reflect how creation actually works, because He designed both the law and the land.</p><p>This is conservatism in its deepest sense: aligning our practices with the order of creation, submitting our ambitions to the wisdom embedded in how things truly are rather than how we wish them to be.</p><h3>The Question of Dominion</h3><p>\"Then God said, 'Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.'\" (Genesis 1:26, NIV)</p><p>This verse has been much abused. Dominion has been read as domination, rulership as exploitation. But consider what kind of king the Scriptures present as ideal: the shepherd king, like David, who tends his flock. The good king does not slaughter his subjects for profit but protects them, provides for them, ensures their flourishing. Christ himself, the King of Kings, is called the Good Shepherd—and the shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</p><p>Our dominion over animals, then, is to be a shepherd's dominion: protective, providing, sacrificial. When we raise animals for food in conditions of such cruelty that we must hide the operations from public view, when we breed them to grow so fast their legs cannot support their bodies, when we confine them in darkness and filth—is this the dominion of a shepherd king? Or is it the tyranny of those who have forgotten that even in our rule over creation, we remain stewards accountable to the One who made both us and them?</p><p>I do not write this to condemn the Idaho rancher who cares for his cattle with diligence and affection. I write to ask: Might there be a way to feed ourselves that does not require us to inflict suffering we would not wish on our own beloved animals? Might the God who created both cattle and grain, both livestock and lentils, have given us the capacity to nourish ourselves without requiring the taking of life from creatures who, like us, fear death and love life?</p><p>This is not sentimentalism. This is theology. \"The righteous care for the needs of their animals,\" says Proverbs. The question is not whether we have the <em>right</em> to use animals—dominion grants us that. The question is whether, in the abundance God has provided, we have the <em>necessity</em> to do so, and whether, if we do not have necessity, righteousness requires restraint.<h2></h2></p><h2>Part II: The Idaho Context — Our Strengths and Our Calling</h2><h3>What Idaho Is (And What It Could Become)</h3><p>Idaho is a state of profound contrasts and complementary strengths. We are at once agrarian and industrial, traditional and innovative, rugged and increasingly refined. Boise grows while the small towns of the high country empty. High-tech companies locate here for the quality of life and business climate, while potato farmers till the same fields their grandfathers worked.</p><p>These are not contradictions to be resolved but complementarities to be cultivated.</p><p><strong>Our Agricultural Heritage:</strong> Idaho is known for potatoes, sugar beets, wheat, barley, dairy, and cattle. We have some of the most productive agricultural land in the nation, irrigated by the Snake River system. We have farmers who know their trade, who understand soil and season, who can make things grow in conditions that would defeat the suburban gardener.</p><p><strong>Our Manufacturing Capacity:</strong> Boise and the Treasure Valley have quietly built a manufacturing sector: food processing, technology manufacturing, construction materials. We have skilled tradespeople, entrepreneurs who understand production, supply chains that connect us to both coasts.</p><p><strong>Our Political Economy:</strong> Idaho is reliably conservative. We value limited government, property rights, free enterprise, and family sovereignty. We are skeptical of federal overreach. We prefer local solutions to distant mandates. We believe that people know better how to run their own lives than bureaucrats in Washington or even Sacramento.</p><p><strong>Our Cultural Foundation:</strong> Idaho has a strong Christian population, particularly evangelical and LDS communities. We value hard work, personal responsibility, family, and faith. These are not mere cultural artifacts but living commitments that shape how we make decisions.</p><p>Given these strengths, what might we build?</p><h3>A Vision: Veganic Agriculture as Conservative Innovation</h3><p>I propose something that may at first sound contradictory: <em>veganic agriculture</em>—agriculture without animal inputs, without animal exploitation—as a natural evolution of conservative Christian farming values.</p><p>Consider the logic:</p><p><strong>Self-Reliance:</strong> A veganic farm is not dependent on external inputs from industrial animal operations. It builds its own fertility through cover crops, composting, and crop rotation. This is the self-sufficiency Idaho values.</p><p><strong>Stewardship:</strong> Veganic methods build soil rather than depleting it. They conserve water (animal agriculture is water-intensive, problematic as the West faces extended drought). They reduce pollution runoff. This is biblical stewardship of the land God entrusted to us.</p><p><strong>Family Values:</strong> Veganic farms can be smaller-scale and still profitable, allowing families to work together on land they own. This preserves the family farm against industrial consolidation.</p><p><strong>Economic Efficiency:</strong> As feed costs rise and water becomes scarcer, the economics of animal agriculture deteriorate. Veganic agriculture eliminates the inefficiency of feeding crops to animals to then harvest the animals. One grows crops and harvests crops—simpler, more direct.</p><p><strong>Christian Compassion:</strong> If we can feed ourselves abundantly without inflicting suffering on God's creatures, does not Christian compassion incline us toward that choice? This is not weakness but the strength of restraint, the virtue of mercy that our Lord commanded.</p><p><strong>Property Rights:</strong> Veganic agriculture eliminates the conflicts that arise when industrial animal operations affect neighbors' property values, water quality, and air quality. It is the neighborly choice.</p><p>The Idaho farmer who transitions to veganic methods remains conservative in every meaningful sense: He owns his land. He provides for his family through his labor. He is self-reliant. He builds rather than extracts. He passes fertile land to his children. And he does it all while causing less harm to God's creation.</p><p>Is this not conservatism rightly understood?<h2></h2></p><h2>Part III: Manufacturing and the Dignity of Work</h2><h3>From Extraction to Creation: A Manufacturing Renaissance</h3><p>Idaho has manufacturing capacity that is underutilized and often misunderstood. We think of manufacturing as either large industrial operations (food processing plants) or small custom work (machine shops, construction). But there is a middle ground that Idaho is perfectly positioned to occupy: <em>artisan manufacturing</em> scaled through cooperation.</p><p>Consider the model of certain European regions—Northern Italy, parts of Germany, the Swiss valleys—where networks of small manufacturers, often family-owned, produce high-quality goods through cooperation rather than consolidation. Each business remains independent, maintains its craft excellence, but they share infrastructure, knowledge, and market access.</p><p>This is the cooperative model—and it is profoundly conservative. It preserves family ownership while achieving economies of scale. It maintains local control while accessing global markets. It honors craft excellence while enabling technological advancement.</p><p>What might Idaho manufacture through such a model?</p><p><strong>Agricultural Equipment Adapted for Veganic Farming:</strong> The equipment needs of veganic agriculture differ from conventional: specialized cover crop seeders, precision composting systems, mechanical cultivation tools for weed management without herbicides. Idaho manufacturers could become the suppliers for a growing national movement toward regenerative, plant-based agriculture.</p><p><strong>Plant-Based Food Products:</strong> Idaho's food processing expertise could be redirected toward plant-based proteins, fermented foods, vegetable-based products. The infrastructure exists. The knowledge exists. What's needed is the will to pivot toward where the market is moving.</p><p><strong>Sustainable Building Materials:</strong> Hemp cultivation (now legal) could feed a building materials industry: hempcrete, insulation, fiber boards. This serves the construction boom in Boise while building rural agricultural economy.</p><p><strong>Textile and Fiber Goods:</strong> Idaho could become a center for North American textile production using plant fibers: hemp, linen, organic cotton. The supply chain would be domestic—grown in Idaho or surrounding states, processed in Idaho, manufactured in Idaho. This is economic sovereignty.</p><p><strong>Precision Technology for Agriculture:</strong> Boise's tech sector could focus on agricultural technology: sensors for soil health, precision irrigation systems, drone-based monitoring. These serve both conventional and veganic farmers while building Idaho's reputation as an agricultural innovation center.</p><h3>The Moral Case for Manufacturing</h3><p>Manufacturing is morally superior to financial manipulation. A man who makes a product—be it a plow or a shirt or a building material—creates something that did not exist before. He adds to the world. He employs his neighbors. He builds wealth that is <em>real</em>: embodied in goods that serve human needs.</p><p>Contrast this with the financialization of the economy, where wealth is made through trading, arbitrage, and speculation—creating nothing, serving no one but the trader himself. This is the economy of the coastal cities, the economy that Idaho voters rightly reject when they support candidates who promise to bring back manufacturing.</p><p>But here is the challenge: We cannot merely wait for manufacturing to return from China. We must build it ourselves, intelligently, focused on where we have advantage: agricultural technology, food processing, natural materials, clean production.</p><p>And we must build it in a manner consistent with our values: family ownership, local control, honest work, quality product, fair dealing.<h2></h2></p><h2>Part IV: Practical Paths for Idaho Citizens</h2><h3>For the Idaho Farmer</h3><p>You know your land better than any bureaucrat in Washington or any activist on the coast. You know what grows here, what the soil needs, what the market wants. </p><p>Consider: What would it take to transition even a portion of your operation to veganic methods? Not all at once—wisdom requires testing—but perhaps one field, one crop, one season.</p><p>The economic case is strengthening: Fertilizer costs are rising. Water is scarcer. Consumer demand for \"plant-forward\" food is growing. The major food companies are all developing plant-based lines. Someone will supply this market. Why not Idaho farmers?</p><p>The Christian case is available for your conscience: Can you feed people abundantly without causing suffering to animals? If so, does stewardship incline you toward that choice?</p><p>The conservative case is clear: Veganic farming is more self-reliant, builds soil, conserves water, reduces pollution, and preserves land for your children.</p><p>You need not do this because California progressives demand it. You can do it because conservative Idaho farmers see wisdom in it.</p><p><strong>Resources available:</strong></p><ul><li>USDA SARE grants support research into innovative practices</li><li>Organic certification programs (veganic methods qualify)</li><li>Growing market for \"regenerative\" and \"plant-based\" products</li><li>Technical assistance from universities and extension services</li></ul><p><strong>Fellowship available:</strong></p><ul><li>Connect with like-minded farmers who are testing veganic methods</li><li>Start informally: coffee meetings, field days, information sharing</li><li>No need for institutional organizational structures—networks suffice</li></ul><h3>For the Idaho Manufacturer or Entrepreneur</h3><p>You understand production. You know how to make things, how to solve problems, how to get product to market. The question is: What should you make?</p><p>Consider the opportunities in plant-based agriculture support:</p><ul><li>Equipment manufacturing (specialized tools for veganic farms)</li><li>Food processing (plant-based proteins, fermented foods)</li><li>Building materials (hemp-based products)</li><li>Agricultural technology (soil sensors, precision equipment)</li></ul><p>These markets are growing. Capital is available for businesses that serve them. But you don't need to go to coastal venture capitalists. You can start small, bootstrap, grow organically (in both senses of the word).</p><p><strong>The cooperative advantage:</strong> Partner with 3-5 other manufacturers. Share equipment, warehouse space, sales efforts. Maintain ownership and independence but achieve scale through cooperation. This is the Idaho way: independent but neighborly.</p><p><strong>The market positioning:</strong> \"Made in Idaho. Supporting American farmers. Building rural economy. Family-owned.\" These are not just slogans—they are genuine advantages that consumers value.</p><h3>For the Idaho Legislator</h3><p>You bear a weighty responsibility: to represent your constituents faithfully, to preserve Idaho's character, to ensure prosperity for the next generation. You rightly resist federal overreach and you champion free enterprise.</p><p>Consider how state policy might support the agricultural and manufacturing renaissance I describe without violating conservative principles:</p><p><strong>Not through subsidies</strong> (which distort markets and create dependency) <strong>but through:</strong></p><p><strong>Regulatory streamlining:</strong> Make it easier to start small food processing businesses, to sell directly to consumers, to establish cooperative structures. Remove barriers that favor large operations over family businesses.</p><p><strong>Education support:</strong> Ensure that Idaho's agricultural education (FFA, 4-H, university extension) includes training in veganic methods, regenerative agriculture, and small-scale manufacturing. Knowledge is power.</p><p><strong>Water policy:</strong> Recognize that veganic agriculture uses less water—this matters as drought persists. Water rights policy should account for efficiency, not merely seniority.</p><p><strong>Property rights protection:</strong> Protect property owners from the negative externalities of industrial animal operations (odor, runoff, property value decline). The conservative position is that your property rights end where your neighbor's begin.</p><p><strong>Market access:</strong> Support farmers markets, direct sales, and local processing facilities. These strengthen rural economies without government spending.</p><p><strong>Procurement:</strong> When state institutions purchase food (schools, prisons, hospitals), preference Idaho producers. This is not protectionism but prudent support for local economy.</p><p>You can champion these policies not as \"progressive\" measures but as conservative ones: They support family farmers, small businesses, property rights, water conservation, and local control. They require no new bureaucracy, minimal spending, and align with Idaho values.</p><h3>For the Young Person Seeking a Path</h3><p>You are eighteen, or twenty-two, or twenty-eight. You may have attended university or you may have chosen work over college debt. You love Idaho—the mountains, the rivers, the character of the people—and you want to build a life here rather than fleeing to Seattle or Denver.</p><p>Consider the paths this essay describes:</p><p><strong>Veganic farming:</strong> Learn agricultural skills through apprenticeship (no degree required, just willingness to work). Build toward operating your own farm or managing one for a family that needs help. Income modest at first ($35,000-$45,000) but grows with experience and eventually land ownership.</p><p><strong>Ag equipment manufacturing:</strong> Learn welding, machining, metalworking through community college or apprenticeship. Work for existing manufacturer or start your own shop serving veganic farmers. Income $45,000-$75,000 as skilled tradesperson.</p><p><strong>Food processing:</strong> Work in or start plant-based food businesses. From production line ($35,000-$45,000) to management ($50,000-$70,000) to ownership (variable but potentially substantial).</p><p><strong>Agricultural technology:</strong> If you have technical aptitude, learn coding, electronics, or engineering through community college or online. Develop technology solutions for farmers. Income $50,000-$90,000 depending on role.</p><p><strong>Policy and advocacy:</strong> Learn through volunteering with conservative organizations, working for legislators, studying policy through reading and experience (not expensive graduate programs). Position yourself as the person who helps conservative legislators understand agricultural innovation. Income modest initially but grows with influence.</p><p>These are not glamorous. Silicon Valley will not write breathless articles about Idaho veganic farmers or agricultural equipment manufacturers. But these are honorable paths that allow you to provide for a family, contribute to your community, and build something lasting.</p><p>And—here is the devotional thread woven through this entire essay—these are paths that allow you to serve. Not to extract, but to serve. To serve the land by stewarding it well. To serve your neighbor by providing good food. To serve God's creatures by treating them with mercy. To serve the next generation by leaving them fertile land and functioning communities.</p><p>This is the heart of Christian vocation: Whatever you do, do it as unto the Lord. The farmer who grows food without cruelty is serving the Lord. The manufacturer who employs his neighbors fairly is serving the Lord. The legislator who writes just laws is serving the Lord. The young person who chooses honest work over easy money is serving the Lord.<h2></h2></p><h2>Part V: Odes to Wisdom — Classical Voices on Stewardship and Work</h2><h3>From the Hebrew Scriptures (Conservative Translations Honored)</h3><p>\"The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.\" (Genesis 2:15, NIV)</p><p><em>Reflection: Before the Fall, before sin, before toil became toilsome—work was gift, not curse. Tending the garden was Adam's holy calling. We too are called to this work: to tend, to keep, to serve the land entrusted to us.</em></p><p>\"Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.\" (Exodus 34:21, NIV)</p><p><em>Reflection: Even when the work is urgent, rest is commanded. Even when profit beckons, Sabbath is required. This is not inefficiency but wisdom—the recognition that we are not masters of our own time, that productivity is not ultimate, that both people and land require rest.</em></p><p>\"A good man leaves an inheritance for his children's children.\" (Proverbs 13:22, NIV)</p><p><em>Reflection: What inheritance shall we leave? Money in bank accounts that inflation devours? Or fertile land, thriving businesses, communities of faith, and the example of work well done? The conservative understands that stewardship is intergenerational—we are links in a chain, not beginning or end.</em></p><h3>From the Christian Tradition</h3><p>\"Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.\" (Colossians 3:23-24, NIV)</p><p><em>Reflection: This transforms all honest work into divine service. The farmer in the field serves the Lord. The manufacturer at the machine serves the Lord. There is no sacred-secular divide in true Christian work—all labor offered to God becomes holy labor.</em></p><p>\"The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.\" (Psalm 24:1, NIV)</p><p><em>Reflection: We own nothing ultimately. We are stewards, managers of what belongs to Another. This should humble our ambitions and check our exploitation. We will give account to the Owner for how we managed His property.</em></p><h3>From the Classical Tradition</h3><p>Virgil, in the <em>Georgics</em> (a work on farming), writes of agriculture as both practical craft and moral education:</p><p><em>\"Blessed is he who has been able to understand the causes of things, and has trampled beneath his feet all fears and inexorable fate and the noise of greedy Acheron.\"</em></p><p><em>Reflection: The farmer who understands how things grow—soil, season, seed—touches something eternal. There is wisdom in the land that the city-dweller never encounters. Conservative agrarianism is not nostalgia but recognition that certain truths are learned only with hands in soil.</em></p><p>Cicero, in <em>De Officiis</em>, discusses the moral superiority of agriculture over trade:</p><p><em>\"Of all the occupations by which gain is secured, none is better than agriculture, none more profitable, none more delightful, none more becoming to a freeman.\"</em></p><p><em>Reflection: The Roman conservative knew what we have forgotten: that producing food is nobler than trading in abstractions, that working land is more honorable than manipulating markets.</em><h2></h2></p><h2>Part VI: A Prayer for Idaho (Bhakti Devotion in Christian Form)</h2><p><em>Let us pray:</em></p><p>Heavenly Father, Creator of heaven and earth, of the mountains that ring the Treasure Valley and the rivers that water our fields—</p><p>We come before You not with demands but with thanksgiving. You have given us this land, this Idaho, with its black soil and its clear streams, its sage-covered hills and its fields of grain. You have given us hands to work and minds to plan and hearts that long for meaning in our labor.</p><p>Forgive us, Lord, where we have been poor stewards. Forgive us where we have chosen profit over principle, convenience over compassion, short-term gain over long-term flourishing. Forgive us where we have exploited Your creation rather than tending it, where we have been harsh rather than gentle with the creatures You entrusted to our care.</p><p>Grant us wisdom to build rightly. Show us how to farm in ways that honor Your creation, how to manufacture with integrity, how to raise our children to value honest work and faithful stewardship. Give our legislators wisdom to write laws that are just, that protect the weak without empowering the corrupt, that preserve freedom while requiring responsibility.</p><p>Help us to see that every potato we plant, every tool we manufacture, every meal we prepare, every job we create—all of it can be offered to You, all of it can be prayer in action, all of it can be service rendered to the Lord Christ.</p><p>We pray for the animals too, Lord. You made them. You delight in them. You command us to care for their needs. Help us to exercise our dominion over them as You exercise Your dominion over us—with mercy, with kindness, with tender care. If we can feed ourselves abundantly without causing them suffering, grant us the wisdom to choose that way.</p><p>We pray for our children and grandchildren. May they inherit from us not just land but wisdom, not just businesses but integrity, not just wealth but character. May Idaho remain a place where a person can work with their hands and provide for their family, where faith is welcomed and virtue is honored, where the mountains stand as witness to Your glory and the rivers run clean because we have tended them well.</p><p>Guard our state, O Lord. Preserve what is good in our culture. Reform what is broken. Give us leaders who fear You more than they fear polls. Give us citizens who love their neighbors more than they love ease. Give us farmers and manufacturers and workers of every kind who see their labor as service to You.</p><p>And when our work is done, when we come at last to give account for how we managed what You entrusted to us, may we hear those words that every faithful steward longs to hear: \"Well done, good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of your Lord.\"</p><p>In the name of Christ Jesus, who was carpenter before He was Rabbi, who worked before He taught, who showed us that all honest labor is holy—</p><p><em>Amen.</em><h2></h2></p><h2>Conclusion: An Invitation to Conservative Stewardship</h2><p>This essay has ranged widely—from theology to economics, from farming to manufacturing, from Boise to the high country. But the thread throughout is singular: <em>conservative stewardship</em>.</p><p>True conservatism conserves. It tends. It keeps. It passes on what was received, improved by faithful labor. It does not exploit the land and hope that future generations will somehow manage. It does not inflict cruelty and call it dominion. It does not trade heritage for immediate profit.</p><p>True conservatism builds: family businesses, local communities, fertile land, honorable work. It understands that wealth is not merely money but includes soil health, water quality, skilled workers, strong families, faith-filled communities.</p><p>Idaho stands at a crossroads. We can continue down the path of industrial agriculture and manufacturing decline, watching our young people leave and our small towns empty. Or we can chart a different course—one that leverages our strengths, honors our values, and builds an economy that serves families rather than demanding that families serve the economy.</p><p>The veganic agriculture and cooperative manufacturing model I have outlined is not un-conservative. It is conservatism rightly understood: property ownership, family business, self-reliance, local control, biblical stewardship, honest work, quality product, fair dealing.</p><p>It does not require becoming progressive. It does not require abandoning your faith or your values. It requires only asking: How can we farm and manufacture in ways that honor God, serve our neighbors, provide for our families, and pass on flourishing to the next generation?</p><p>If you are a farmer, consider testing veganic methods on a portion of your land. If you are a manufacturer, consider what products would serve this emerging agricultural model. If you are a legislator, consider policies that support family farms and small manufacturers without creating dependency or overreach. If you are a young person, consider whether these paths might allow you to build a life in Idaho rather than leaving it.</p><p>And all of us—farmer, manufacturer, legislator, citizen—might ask in our prayers: Lord, how would You have me steward what You have given me? How can my work serve You? How can I leave this place better than I found it?</p><p>The answers will differ for each of us. But the question is the same, and it is the most conservative question there is: How shall we conserve what we have been given? How shall we pass it on, improved by our labor, to those who come after?</p><p>Idaho, you have been given much. Let us show ourselves worthy of the gift.<h2></h2></p><p><strong>Released to Public Domain in Service of Truth and Stewardship.</strong><br /> <strong>For the farmers, manufacturers, and citizens of Idaho.</strong><br /> <strong>For the legislators who bear the weight of governance.</strong><br /> <strong>For the young people who will inherit what we build.</strong><br /> <strong>For the glory of God and the good of all creation.</strong><h2></h2></p><p><em>\"The righteous care for the needs of their animals.\"</em><br /> <em>— Proverbs 12:10</em></p><p><em>Go and do likewise.</em></p><p>🏔️🌾🛠️<h2></h2></p><p><strong>Timestamp</strong>: <code>12025-10-06--rhizome-valley</code><br /> <strong>Iteration</strong>: 9975v (Vegan Autodidact Variant - Conservative Idaho Edition)<br /></p><p><strong>Context:</strong> Boise and Treasure Valley, Idaho farming and manufacturing, conservative Christian values, Romantic European prose, bhakti devotion as Christian prayer, classical wisdom, Republican legislators and electorate</p><p><em>\"For the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.\"</em></p><p><em>Steward it well.</em><br /> <em>Build with integrity.</em><br /> <em>Serve with devotion.</em></p><p>🙏<h2></h2></p><p><div style=\"text-align: center; opacity: 0.6; font-size: 0.85em; margin-top: 3em; padding-top: 1em; border-top: 1px solid rgba(139, 116, 94, 0.2);\"></p><p><strong>Copyright © 2025 <a href='https://codeberg.org/kae3g/12025-10/'>kae3g</a></strong> | Dual-licensed under <a href='https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0'>Apache-2.0</a> / <a href='https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT'>MIT</a><br /> Competitive technology in service of clarity and beauty</p><p></div></p>",
