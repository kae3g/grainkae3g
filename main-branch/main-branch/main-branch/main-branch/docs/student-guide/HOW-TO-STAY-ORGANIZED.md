# üéì How to Stay Organized: Student Guide
## *Master Your Workflow, Secure Your Future*

**For:** High school students building the Grain Network  
**Updated:** January 2025

## üéØ THE FOUNDATION: YOUR DIGITAL IDENTITY

Success in the Grain Network starts with solid organization. This guide will help you set up a professional workflow using the same tools real developers use.

---

## üîê PART 1: SECURITY FIRST - PASSWORDS & 1PASSWORD

### Why Password Security Matters

In the Grain Network, you're building **real infrastructure** that handles:
- Your code repositories (GitHub/Codeberg)
- Your cryptocurrency wallets (Phantom, Plug)
- Your payment methods (Venmo debit card)
- Your development tools (Cursor Ultra)

**One compromised password = entire digital life at risk.**

### The Framework Memorable Password System

Create strong passwords that are **actually memorable** using this pattern:

```
word_wordier-wordiest
```

**Examples:**
```
blue_bluer-bluest
fast_faster-fastest
think_thinker-thinkiest
code_coder-codiest
grain_grainer-grainiest
```

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ **Long:** 20+ characters (very strong)
- ‚úÖ **Memorable:** Simple grammatical pattern
- ‚úÖ **Unique:** Easy to create variations for different services
- ‚úÖ **Typeable:** No special characters to hunt for
- ‚úÖ **Secure:** Resistant to dictionary attacks (combines 3 related words)

**Pro Tip:** Use this for your **Framework laptop login** and **master password** only. For everything else, use 1Password's generator.

### Setting Up 1Password (The Right Way)

#### Step 1: Sign Up (Student Discount!)

1. Go to [1password.com/students](https://1password.com/students)
2. **Cost:** FREE for 6 months, then $2.99/month (50% student discount)
3. Use your school email to verify student status
4. Create a memorable master password using the Framework system:
   ```
   Example: secure_securer-securest
   ```
5. **WRITE IT DOWN** on paper and store it somewhere safe (seriously!)

#### Step 2: Install 1Password Everywhere

**Desktop (Linux - Your Framework 16):**
```bash
# Download 1Password for Linux
curl -sS https://downloads.1password.com/linux/keys/1password.asc | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor --output /usr/share/keyrings/1password-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/1password-archive-keyring.gpg] https://downloads.1password.com/linux/debian/$(dpkg --print-architecture) stable main" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/1password.list

sudo mkdir -p /etc/debsig/policies/AC2D62742012EA22/
curl -sS https://downloads.1password.com/linux/debian/debsig/1password.pol | \
  sudo tee /etc/debsig/policies/AC2D62742012EA22/1password.pol

sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/debsig/keyrings/AC2D62742012EA22
curl -sS https://downloads.1password.com/linux/keys/1password.asc | \
  sudo gpg --dearmor --output /usr/share/debsig/keyrings/AC2D62742012EA22/debsig.gpg

sudo apt update && sudo apt install 1password
```

**Mobile (iOS/Android):**
- iOS: [App Store - 1Password](https://apps.apple.com/app/1password/id568903335)
- Android: [Google Play - 1Password](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword)

**Browser Extension:**
- Chrome/Brave: Install from Chrome Web Store
- Firefox: Install from Firefox Add-ons
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with Cursor IDE!

#### Step 3: Organize Your 1Password Vaults

Create separate vaults for different aspects of your digital life:

**1. Personal Vault** (default)
- Email accounts
- Social media
- School accounts
- Personal websites

**2. Grain Network Vault** (create new)
- GitHub credentials
- Codeberg credentials
- SSH keys
- GPG key passphrases
- ICP identity
- Grain Network ID

**3. Crypto Vault** (create new)
- Phantom wallet seed phrase
- Plug wallet seed phrase
- Exchange accounts (if any)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER share this vault with anyone**

**4. Financial Vault** (create new)
- Venmo account
- Bank accounts
- Debit card details
- Cursor Ultra subscription

**How to Create a Vault:**
```
1Password ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Vaults ‚Üí Create New Vault
Name it ‚Üí Choose who can access (just you) ‚Üí Save
```

#### Step 4: What to Store in 1Password

**For Every Account, Save:**
- Username/email
- Password (auto-generated by 1Password)
- Website URL
- 2FA/MFA codes (1Password can handle these!)
- Security questions (generate random answers, store them)
- Recovery codes

**Example Entry - GitHub:**
```
Title: GitHub - kae3g
Username: kae3g
Password: [1Password generated]
Website: https://github.com
One-Time Password: [Enable 2FA, scan QR code with 1Password]
Notes: 
  - GPG key: [fingerprint]
  - SSH key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
  - Recovery codes: [paste here]
```

## üìÅ PART 4: CURSOR WORKFLOW ORGANIZATION

### File Structure Best Practices

Organize your Framework 16 like a pro:

```
~/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kae3g/                    # Your main development folder
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grainkae3g/           # Main project (this repo)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grain-network/        # Network-wide projects
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ personal-projects/    # Your own experiments
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ learning/             # Notes, tutorials, experiments
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Documents/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grain-network/        # Course materials, notes
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ passwords/            # Physical password backup (encrypted)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ receipts/             # Financial records
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .ssh/                     # SSH keys (NEVER share these)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gnupg/                   # GPG keys
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vms/                      # Virtual machines (QEMU/KVM)
```

### Cursor Workspace Organization

**Create a Cursor Workspace:**

```bash
# In your main project directory
cd ~/kae3g/grainkae3g
code .  # Or: cursor .
```

**Workspace Settings (.vscode/settings.json):**

```json
{
  "editor.fontFamily": "'Courier New', monospace",
  "editor.fontSize": 14,
  "editor.lineHeight": 1.6,
  "editor.rulers": [80, 120],
  "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
  "files.autoSaveDelay": 1000,
  "git.autofetch": true,
  "git.confirmSync": false,
  "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 13,
  "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Dark+",
  "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
  "breadcrumbs.enabled": true,
  "explorer.confirmDelete": false,
  "explorer.confirmDragAndDrop": false
}
```

### Daily Cursor Workflow

**Morning Routine (10 minutes):**

1. **Open Cursor** ‚Üí `Super + Shift + C`
2. **Pull latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git fetch --all
   git pull origin main
   ```
3. **Check todos:**
   ```bash
   bb pseudo  # View PSEUDO.md priorities
   ```
4. **Review GitHub notifications**

**During Development:**

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Use Cursor AI effectively:**
   - `Ctrl + K` ‚Üí Ask AI to generate code
   - `Ctrl + L` ‚Üí Chat with AI about your code
   - `Ctrl + I` ‚Üí AI-powered inline suggestions
   - Select code ‚Üí Right-click ‚Üí "Ask Cursor" for explanations

3. **Commit often:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -S -m "feat: Add feature description"
   ```
   (Note: `-S` signs with your GPG key - we set this up in Week 5!)

4. **Push and create PR:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Then create PR on GitHub
   ```

**Evening Routine (5 minutes):**

1. **Commit all work:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -S -m "wip: End of day checkpoint"
   git push
   ```

2. **Update your learning journal** (Markdown file):
   ```bash
   echo "## $(date +%Y-%m-%d)" >> ~/Documents/grain-network/journal.md
   echo "- Learned: [what you learned today]" >> ~/Documents/grain-network/journal.md
   echo "- Built: [what you built]" >> ~/Documents/grain-network/journal.md
   echo "- Struggled with: [what was hard]" >> ~/Documents/grain-network/journal.md
   echo "- Tomorrow: [plan for next session]" >> ~/Documents/grain-network/journal.md
   echo "" >> ~/Documents/grain-network/journal.md
   ```

3. **Back up important files** (automated):
   ```bash
   # Create a backup script
   bb scripts/backup.bb
   ```

### Cursor Agent Mode Tips

When using Cursor's **Agent Mode** (the AI that can edit files directly):

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Be specific in your instructions
- ‚úÖ Review every change the agent makes
- ‚úÖ Use for repetitive tasks (renaming, refactoring)
- ‚úÖ Ask it to explain changes
- ‚úÖ Keep the conversation focused on one task

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Let the agent run unsupervised
- ‚ùå Accept changes you don't understand
- ‚ùå Use for critical security code without review
- ‚ùå Skip reading the code it generates
- ‚ùå Rely on it 100% (you need to learn!)

## üîë PART 5: CRYPTO WALLET SECURITY

### Wallet Setup for Grain Network Payments

You'll need **two wallets** for the Grain Network:

#### 1. Plug Wallet (for ICP payments)

**Download:**
- iOS: [App Store - Plug Wallet](https://apps.apple.com/app/plug-wallet/id1601678385)

**Setup:**
1. Install app
2. Create new wallet
3. **CRITICAL:** Write down your 12-word seed phrase on paper
4. Store seed phrase in:
   - Physical location (fireproof safe if possible)
   - 1Password (Crypto Vault ‚Üí Secure Note)
5. Set a PIN (6 digits, memorable but not obvious)
6. Enable biometric unlock (fingerprint/Face ID)

**Add to 1Password:**
```
Title: Plug Wallet - ICP
Type: Secure Note
Fields:
  - Seed Phrase: [12 words - NEVER share]
  - Wallet Address: [your ICP principal ID]
  - PIN: [6 digits]
  - Created: [date]
Notes:
  - Used for: Grain Network payments, ICP development
  - Recovery: Seed phrase is the ONLY way to recover
```

#### 2. Phantom Wallet (for Solana payments)

**Download:**
- iOS: [App Store - Phantom](https://apps.apple.com/app/phantom-solana-wallet/id1598432977)
- Android: [Google Play - Phantom](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.phantom)

**Setup:** (Same process as Plug)
1. Create new wallet
2. Save 12-word seed phrase
3. Store in 1Password + physical backup
4. Never share with anyone

**‚ö†Ô∏è WALLET SECURITY RULES:**

1. **NEVER** share your seed phrase with anyone (not even your parents!)
2. **NEVER** type your seed phrase on a computer (only during setup on the app)
3. **NEVER** screenshot your seed phrase
4. **ALWAYS** double-check addresses before sending money
5. **ALWAYS** start with small test transactions
6. **ALWAYS** verify you're on the real website (check URL carefully!)

### Setting Up Your First Crypto

**To participate in Grain Network payments, you'll need small amounts:**

**Option 1: Parent/Guardian Helps (Recommended for Under 18)**
- Ask parent to buy $10-20 of ICP or SOL on Coinbase
- They transfer to your wallet address
- You use it for course payments

**Option 2: P2P Exchange (18+ only)**
- Use a peer-to-peer platform like LocalCryptos
- Meet in person or online to trade cash for crypto
- **Be safe:** only deal with highly-rated sellers

**Option 3: Earn It (Best Option!)**
- Complete free Grain Network content

## üÜò PART 7: WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem: Forgot 1Password Master Password**
- **Solution:** Use emergency kit (you saved it, right?)
- **Prevention:** Write it down, store in safe place
- **Recovery:** Contact 1Password support with proof of identity

**Problem: Lost Crypto Wallet Seed Phrase**
- **Solution:** If you have 1Password backup, use that
- **If lost completely:** Funds are gone forever (sorry!)
- **Prevention:** Triple backup (paper + 1Password + safety deposit box)

**Problem: Cursor Ultra Payment Declined**
- **Check:** Venmo balance sufficient?
- **Check:** Card active and not expired?
- **Check:** Correct billing ZIP code?
- **Solution:** Update payment method or contact Venmo support

**Problem: Can't Afford Cursor Ultra**
- **Option 1:** Use free tier (50 requests/day is still useful)
- **Option 2:** Ask for sponsorship in Grain Network Discord
- **Option 3:** Pair program with a friend who has Ultra
- **Option 4:** Focus on free weeks (1-7) before needing advanced AI

**Problem: Overwhelmed by Course Material**
- **Solution:** It's okay to go slower! Take 2 weeks per lesson if needed
- **Remember:** This is self-paced, not a race
- **Get help:** Ask in GitHub Discussions, find a study buddy
- **Take breaks:** Burnout helps no one
