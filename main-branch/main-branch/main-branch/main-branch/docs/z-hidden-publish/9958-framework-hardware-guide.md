# kae3g 9958: Choosing Your Expedition Pack — Framework Laptop for Valley Builders

**Timestamp:** 12025-10-10--rhizome-valley  
**Series:** Rhizome Valley Chronicles  
**Category:** Hardware, Framework, AMD, Development Environment  
**Reading Time:** 20 minutes

> **"You've met the teachers, learned the philosophies, practiced the techniques. Now you need your physical tools—the hardware that will carry you through the valley. Choose wisely, for your laptop is more than a machine: it's your workshop, your laboratory, your forge."**

## The Hardware Scout's Guidance

*As we prepare to leave the Training Grounds, a new figure emerges from the workshop—the Hardware Scout, a pragmatic engineer who has tested every tool on real expeditions.*

*"Listen," she says, pulling up two Framework laptops. "I've been building systems in the valley for years. Your hardware choice matters. Not because of raw power—you can get that anywhere. It matters because of **repairability, openness, and Linux compatibility**. These Framework machines? They're designed for builders like us."*

*She opens both laptops side by side, their modular ports gleaming in the workshop light.*

## The Choice: Portability vs Capability

## Hardware Comparison

```clojure
{:framework-13
 {:display "13.5\" 2256×1504"
  :weight "1.3 kg"
  :cpu "AMD Ryzen 7 7840U (8-core)"
  :best-for "Portability, terminal workflows, budget"}}

{:framework-16
 {:display "16\" 2560×1600"
  :weight "2.1-2.4 kg"
  :cpu "AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS"
  :gpu "Optional AMD Radeon RX 7700S (removable!)"
  :best-for "Graphics dev (Redox orbital), multi-monitor, future-proof"}}
```

## Why AMD for Our Valley Journey?

*The Hardware Scout taps the AMD logo on both machines.*

*"Intel?" she scoffs. "They're still playing closed-source games with drivers. AMD opened their hearts to Linux years ago. That's why every valley builder I know runs AMD."*

**The AMD Advantages:**
- **Open-source drivers** (amdgpu in mainline kernel)—no binary blobs, no proprietary mysteries
- **Better power efficiency** than Intel—longer battery life for working in remote locations
- **Full Linux support out-of-box**—no hunting for drivers, no compatibility nightmares
- **Perfect for graphics development**—especially if you're building orbital (Redox's display server from [9955](9955-redox-os-rust-microkernel))

*"When the Rust Blacksmith builds Redox graphics," the Scout adds, "she uses AMD. When the Pragmatic Pioneer tests init systems, he uses AMD. When SixOS deploys services? AMD. It's the valley standard."*

## The Scout's Final Wisdom

*The Hardware Scout closes both laptops and looks at you directly.*

*"Here's what I tell every valley builder: **Start with the Framework 13 unless you know you need more**. It's elegant, affordable, and powerful enough for everything you've learned—from Clojure REPLs to Nix builds to runit services to Rust supervision. The 13 is your trusted companion."*

*"But," she continues, opening the Framework 16 again, "if you're going deep into Redox graphics development, if you need multiple monitors for debugging complex systems, if you want that modular GPU for experimenting with compute-intensive tasks—then the 16 is your forge."*

**The Scout's Recommendations:**

- **Framework 13 AMD (Ryzen 7 7840U)** — For most valley builders
  - Perfect for: Terminal workflows, Clojure/Nix development, init system experimentation
  - Advantages: Lightweight (1.3kg), excellent battery life, affordable
  - Best for: Essays 9949-9957 (foundations through Rust supervision)

- **Framework 16 AMD (Ryzen 9 7940HS + optional dGPU)** — For advanced expeditions
  - Perfect for: Graphics development, multi-monitor setups, compute-heavy work
  - Advantages: Expandable, removable GPU, future-proof
  - Best for: Deep dives into Redox orbital, seL4 verification, grainhouse building

*"Whichever you choose," the Scout says, handing you a small toolkit, "you'll have something the old proprietary laptops never offered: **the right to repair**. You can swap every component. You can upgrade years from now. You're not buying a sealed black box—you're investing in a long-term relationship with your tools."*

*She smiles. "That's the valley way. Open hardware for open systems."*

## The Journey Continues

*With your Framework laptop chosen and your toolkit in hand, you're ready for the next critical decision: which operating system foundation will you build upon?*

*The Scout gestures toward a distant crossroads. "Three paths await you, each with its own philosophy. The Void Path, minimal and pure. The Artix Path, elegant and systemd-free. And the Cosmopolitan Path, build-once run-anywhere. Your choice will shape everything that follows."*

*"The tools you choose shape the systems you build. Choose tools that respect your freedom."*  
— The Hardware Scout's Wisdom

*Framework laptops embody this philosophy: modular, repairable, open.*
