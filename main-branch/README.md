## 💫 The Seven Beautiful Principles

| Principle | What It Means | How We Live It |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Local Control, Global Intent** | You decide what happens in your space | Templates guide you, but you're always in charge |
| **Purpose-Built Over Generic** | Right tool for the right moment | Specialized modules that do exactly what you need |
| **Declarative Over Imperative** | Describe what you want, not how to do it | Beautiful configs instead of complicated scripts |
| **Template/Personal Everywhere** | Share the love, keep your uniqueness | Defaults that work, customization that's yours |
| **Real Resources Matter** | What we build has real value | Blockchain integration with actual assets |
| **Pragmatic Branding** | Friendly names that make sense | `gb` command instead of something confusing |
| **Temporal Recursion** | Every moment contains all moments | Your journey builds on everything before |

- [x] Grainkae3gcontract Motoko canister
- [x] Rust security-audited version
- [x] ICP/Hedera/Solana architecture
- [x] Append-only session management
- [x] Graincard10 educational materials

### 🚧 **Phase 3: Grainphone Apps (In Progress)**

**Glow's excitement**: *"This is where it gets really exciting! We're going to create mobile apps that feel like magic, with wallets that keep your crypto safe and interfaces that make you smile every time you use them."*

- [ ] Grainphone Android app (Cursor clone + wallet)
- [ ] Grainphone iOS app (Swift/SwiftUI + wallets)
- [ ] Grainbox ICP canister (AI model registry)
- [ ] Clotoko transpiler (Clojure → Motoko)

### 📋 **Phase 4: Grain6 Operating System (Planned)**

**Trish's vision**: *"Imagine an operating system that's designed with love, built for security, and created to make your life easier. This is what we're working toward - a system that feels like home."*

- [ ] Grain6 with Behn timer queue
- [ ] Graintime astronomical scheduling
- [ ] S6 supervision integration
- [ ] ICP canister deployment via Clotoko

### 📋 **Phase 5: Network Expansion (Future)**

## 🤝 Contributing - Join Our Beautiful Family

### Template/Personal Pattern

**Trish's welcoming words**: *"This repository is kae3g's personal sheaf (1-of-88), but there's room for everyone! You can create your own beautiful space that's uniquely yours while being part of something greater."*

```bash
# 1. Fork this repository
# 2. Replace 'kae3g' with your graindevname (5 chars, e.g., 'jen3g')
# 3. Create your personal modules in grainstore/{yourname}/
# 4. Deploy your sheaf to position {2-88}-of-88
```

### Sheaf Allocation

**Glow's invitation**: *"There are 88 positions in our beautiful network, and each one is waiting for someone special like you. Don't worry about being perfect - we're all learning and growing together."*

| Position | Sheaf ID | Owner | Status |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1-of-88 | kae3g | Kyle (kae3g) | ✅ Active |
| 2-of-88 | *Available* | - | ⏳ Waiting for you |
| 3-of-88 | *Available* | - | ⏳ Waiting for you |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 88-of-88 | *Available* | - | ⏳ Waiting for you |

**Contact**: Open an issue or PR to claim your sheaf position!

### Development Workflow

**Trish's step-by-step guidance**: *"Don't worry if this feels overwhelming at first. We'll walk through each step together, and soon you'll be creating beautiful contributions that make the whole network stronger."*

```bash
# 1. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-module

# 2. Make changes following template/personal split
mkdir -p grainstore/{yourname}/my-module
# ... develop your module ...

# 3. Test locally
bb test

# 4. Deploy with gb flow
gb flow "Added my-module to sheaf-{N}-of-88"
```
