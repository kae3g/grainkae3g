# A Note on Grothendieck: Attribution, Apology, and Accessibility

*Why his name was removed from titles, and why that honors him*

---

## For Scholars and Curious Readers

If you've been reading essays in the 9098 series, you've encountered "the rising sea method" without seeing the name of the person who invented it. That was intentional—and I owe you an explanation.

This method comes from **Alexander Grothendieck** (1928-2014), one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century. In 1984, he described his approach as letting understanding rise like a sea, slowly and patiently, until impossible problems become naturally solvable.

**This essay exists to give him full credit, explain my reasoning for delaying attribution, and apologize directly to him.**

---

## Why I Delayed Telling You His Name

### The Practical Reason

Grothendieck's name is beautiful but challenging to pronounce (Gro-ten-deek). If an essay—or the book it's becoming—is titled "Grothendieck's Rising Sea," many readers might not start. 

**Accessibility matters more than credit in titles.**

A high school student in rural Idaho won't click on "Grothendieck's Rising Sea." But they might click on "The Rising Sea Method: How to Solve Impossible Problems."

A community organizer in Miami, dealing with literal rising seas from climate change, needs this method. They won't find it if the title creates barriers.

A repair cafe coordinator in Berlin, trying to figure out how to scale their work across the city, deserves access to this thinking. They're more likely to engage with "Patient Foundation Building" than with a French mathematician's name.

### The Deeper Reason

**This is what Grothendieck would have wanted.**

His entire life was about making mathematics accessible, not about personal glory. He cared about spreading understanding, not collecting fame. He resigned from prestigious positions when he felt they compromised his principles. He gave away his ideas freely. He built foundations for others to stand on.

When his former student Pierre Deligne won a Fields Medal for work building on Grothendieck's foundations, Grothendieck felt hurt—not because Pierre succeeded, but because he felt the mathematical community hadn't properly valued the patient foundation-building that made that success possible. 

He experienced the pain of seeing his life's work underappreciated.

So here's my reasoning: **I honor Grothendieck MORE by making his method accessible to a million teenagers, community organizers, farmers, and everyday builders than by putting his name prominently in titles that create barriers.**

The 9098 series spreads his method widely. That's what he spent his life doing.

## Who He Was

**Alexander Grothendieck** transformed algebraic geometry in the 1960s and 70s. His approach wasn't to solve specific problems—it was to create entirely new mathematical languages that made whole classes of problems naturally solvable.

### His Life

- **Born stateless**: 1928, to anarchist parents. His father died in Auschwitz.
- **Survived World War II**: As a refugee child in France during the Nazi occupation.
- **Became one of mathematics' greatest minds**: By age 30, revolutionizing algebraic geometry.
- **Resigned from prestigious positions**: Left the IHÉS (Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques) in 1970 when he learned they took military funding. Gave up comfort for principle.
- **Later withdrew from the mathematical community**: Lived in seclusion in the French Pyrenees, focused on philosophical reflection.
- **Died in 2014**: Alone in a village, having requested no funeral, no grave marker.

### His Work

Grothendieck's mathematical contributions include:
- **Schemes**: A new language for algebraic geometry
- **Étale cohomology**: A tool that unlocked entire fields of mathematics
- **Topoi (toposes)**: Categorical foundations that unified disparate mathematical structures
- **The rising sea method**: His philosophical approach to all mathematical work

But his deepest contribution wasn't any specific theorem. It was **teaching mathematics to rebuild foundations patiently, so that impossibly hard problems become naturally simple.**

### His Masterwork

*Récoltes et Semailles* (Harvests and Sowings), written 1983-1986, is a thousand-page reflection on mathematics, creativity, ethics, and his experience in the mathematical world.

For decades, only French-reading mathematicians could access it (via photocopies). In 2025, MIT Press published the first English translation by Leila Schneps.

If you want to understand Grothendieck's heart, read *Harvests and Sowings*. It's raw, vulnerable, brilliant, and often painful. He writes about:
- The joy of mathematical discovery
- The ethics of military funding in research
- The pain of feeling undervalued by his community
- The nature of creativity and reception
- What it means to build foundations others will use

## The Apology

Grothendieck, if you're somehow reading this from beyond:

**I'm sorry for removing your name from the title.**

I know you experienced plagiarism and under-attribution in your life. I know it hurt. Pierre Deligne built on your work and won recognition—deserved recognition—but you felt the foundations you laid weren't properly valued. That pain shows up again and again in *Harvests and Sowings*.

**But I also know your heart.**

You cared about **understanding reaching people**, not about monuments to yourself. You resigned from the prestigious IHÉS because they took military funding. You gave up your salary, your position, your academic security—for principle.

You valued **truth and accessibility** over recognition.

You spent your life building mathematical languages that made the impossible simple. You didn't do it for fame. You did it because **you loved seeing understanding spread.**

So here's why I removed your name from the title, and why I believe this honors you:

**I want your method to reach a million teenagers** who would never pick up a book about a French mathematician with a hard-to-pronounce name.

**I want community organizers** dealing with climate crisis to use your patient accumulation method to build resilient infrastructure.

**I want farmers** transitioning to regenerative agriculture to understand that slow foundation-building creates ecosystems that outlast them.

**I want repair cafe coordinators** to see that raising the sea level of community knowledge is more powerful than training individual experts.

**I want your method in the hands of everyday builders**, not locked behind academic gatekeeping.

That honors your life more than keeping your name prominent.

## The Plan: Essays 9098-9996

The 9098 series will be approximately 900 essays applying the rising sea method to:
- Climate action (building systems that make fossil fuels obsolete)
- Community resilience (infrastructure that survives crisis)
- Regenerative agriculture (soil food webs as rising seas)
- Open hardware (Framework laptops, right-to-repair)
- Sovereign computing (s6, NixOS, formal verification)
- Economic democracy (worker ownership, tool libraries, community land trusts)
- And hundreds more applications

**Every single one will credit you in the bibliography.**

The series title page will read:

> **The Rising Sea Method: 900 Essays on Patient Foundation Building**
> 
> *Based on the mathematical philosophy of Alexander Grothendieck (1928-2014)*
> 
> *For full attribution and apology, see Essay 9297*

This ensures:
- **Accessibility**: Beginners can start without intimidation
- **Attribution**: Scholars know exactly where it comes from
- **Honor**: Your method reaches the people who need it most

## For Readers: Why This Matters

If you're reading the 9098 series and wondering "Where did this come from?", now you know.

**Alexander Grothendieck invented this method.**

He spent his life showing that patient foundation-building—raising the sea level of understanding—makes impossible peaks walkable.

Now it's our job to apply his method to the challenges he didn't live to see solved:
- Climate crisis (rising seas of carbon)
- Economic inequality (rising seas of shared ownership)
- Electronic waste (rising seas of repairability knowledge)
- Food systems (rising seas of living soil)

**We honor him by doing the work.**

Not by monuments. Not by putting his name on everything. But by spreading his method so widely that a generation from now, people use it without knowing where it came from—because it's become obvious, natural, the way everyone builds.

That's what he wanted.

## A Closing Thought

There's a beautiful passage in *Harvests and Sowings* where Grothendieck writes about mathematical work as planting seeds for future generations to harvest.

He knew he wouldn't live to see all the applications of his methods. He planted them anyway.

**This series is part of that harvest.**

Nine hundred essays won't solve climate crisis or economic inequality. But they might give a million builders the method they need to raise the sea level of possibility.

Grothendieck planted. We harvest. Others will plant using what we've harvested.

**The sea rises patient.**
