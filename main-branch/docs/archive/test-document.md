# Test Document

This is a test document for the documentation
pipeline. It demonstrates the 57-character line
wrapping and markdown processing capabilities that
make technical documentation clear and accessible.

## Features

The pipeline includes these powerful features:

- **Markdown Processing** - Parse and transform text
- **57-Character Wrapping** - Clean, readable format
- **Svelte Generation** - Modern web components
- **Static Site Output** - Fast, zero dependencies
- **Automated Building** - One command deployment

## Pipeline Stages

Your document flows through these automated stages:

1. **Wrapping** - Apply 57-character line limit
2. **Parsing** - Extract structure and metadata
3. **Validation** - Verify spec compliance
4. **Generation** - Create Svelte components
5. **Build** - Compile to static website

Each stage ensures quality and consistency.
