# The Mathematical Constitution of Rhizome Valley

**Adopted**: October 10, 2025  
**Branch**: `coldriver-heal`  
**Status**: Living Document

---

## Preamble

> *"We hold these truths to be mathematically provable."*

Most computing systems are built on sand‚Äîshifting specifications, corporate whims, historical accidents. We choose different. We choose **mathematical bedrock**.

This document establishes the foundational principles of the Rhizome Valley project: a commitment to **frozen specifications**, **verifiable implementations**, and **century-long software**.

---

## The Rosetta Stone: Nock

**At the heart of our valley lies a discovery**: A specification so minimal it can be held in the mind, so precise it can be proven on paper, so eternal it will outlast us all.

**Nock** is our Rosetta Stone‚Äîa direct translation between three languages:

1. **The Eternal Language** (mathematics): Pure functions, noun transformations, 12 reduction rules
2. **The Architectural Language** (system design): Kernels, runtimes, services, abstractions
3. **The Physical Language** (silicon): RISC-V instructions, verified microcode, open hardware

This is not just an implementation detail. It is a **constitutional choice**‚Äîa decision to root everything in mathematical truth rather than historical accumulation.

---

## Article I: The Frozen Foundation

### ¬ß1. The Specification

The foundation of all computation in the Valley shall be the **Nock specification**:

**12 reduction rules. Frozen. Immutable. Eternal.**

```
?[a b]           0               # cell test
?a               1               # atom test
+[a b]           +[a b]          # increment (crashes on cell)
+a               1 + a           # increment atom
=[a a]           0               # equality (yes)
=[a b]           1               # equality (no)
/[1 a]           a               # tree addressing (root)
/[2 a b]         a               # left branch
/[3 a b]         b               # right branch
/[(a + a) b]     /[2 /[a b]]    # even (recurse left)
/[(a + a + 1) b] /[3 /[a b]]    # odd (recurse right)
*[...]           [...]           # 12 nock formulas (see full spec)
```

**This specification shall never change.**

### ¬ß2. Rationale

We freeze the foundation for three reasons:

1. **Verifiability**: A 12-rule specification is **auditable** by a small team, **provable** with formal methods, **teachable** in an afternoon. Compare: POSIX (3,700 pages), JVM spec (600 pages), x86 (5,000 pages). We choose simplicity not for aesthetics, but for **verification tractability**.

2. **Longevity**: Specifications that change cannot support century-long software. By freezing Nock, we guarantee: Code written in 2025 will execute identically in 2125.

3. **Sovereignty**: When the foundation is eternal and open, we cannot be locked in, locked out, or obsoleted by vendor decisions. We control our computational destiny.

### ¬ß3. The Schelling Point

Nock is not just a technical choice‚Äîit is a **social technology**.

A specification with 12 rules is not just auditable by experts; it is **masterable by a community**. Unlike POSIX or JVM, which require priesthoods, Nock creates a **Schelling point**‚Äîa natural focus for coordination and shared understanding.

This enables:
- **Democratized verification** (community-scale, not nation-state-scale)
- **Intellectual longevity** (stable foundation for discourse)
- **Educational accessibility** (teach the entire foundation in hours, not years)

---

## Article II: Verified Derivation

### ¬ß1. Implementation Principle

All implementations‚Äîkernels, runtimes, compilers, services‚Äîshall be **derived** from the Nock specification.

**Derivation means**:
- Formal specification in Nock (the "what")
- Verified translation to implementation language (C, Rust, RISC-V assembly)
- Proof of semantic equivalence (implementation = specification)

### ¬ß2. Jets: Optimized Equivalents

Performance requires optimization. Verification requires purity. Jets bridge both.

**A jet is**:
- An optimized subroutine (e.g., in C or Rust)
- Provably equivalent to a Nock expression
- Used when performance matters, with fallback to pure Nock for verification

**Example**:
```
Nock formula: [4 [0 1]]  (increment subject)
Jet (C):      x + 1
Proof:        Both compute the same function (increment)
```

Jets are the bridge between Platonic purity (Nock) and Aristotelian efficiency (silicon).

### ¬ß3. The Three Layers

**Layer 1 - Kernel** (specified in Nock):
- Process management
- Memory allocation
- IPC (inter-process communication)
- Hardware abstraction

**Layer 2 - Runtime** (specified in Nock, optimized via jets):
- Clojure semantics (persistent data structures, lazy evaluation, concurrency)
- Nix evaluation model (declarative builds, reproducibility)
- Language interop (polyglot capabilities)

**Layer 3 - Applications** (written in Clojure/Nix, compiled to Nock):
- User programs
- System utilities
- Configuration management

All three layers share one specification language. All three are verifiable.

---

## Article III: Eternal Simplicity

### ¬ß1. No Growth

**The specification shall never grow.**

Nock's 12 rules are complete‚Äînot because they're limited, but because they're **sufficient**. All computation can be expressed. All optimizations can be achieved (via jets). All abstractions can be built (in layers above).

Adding rules would:
- Increase verification burden
- Break the Schelling point
- Violate the eternal contract

**We commit**: The 12 rules are final.

### ¬ß2. Complexity Above, Simplicity Below

**Complexity is inevitable.** Software grows. Requirements change. Ecosystems evolve.

**Our principle**: Complexity **emerges in layers**, but the **foundation remains frozen**.

```
Complex applications (Clojure/Nix)
    ‚Üì compiled to
Intermediate abstractions (jets, libraries)
    ‚Üì specified in
Nock (12 rules, frozen)
    ‚Üì executed on
RISC-V (open ISA, minimal)
```

This is the permaculture principle applied to computing: **A resilient seed (Nock) supports a complex ecosystem (applications) without constant tilling (spec changes).**

### ¬ß3. The Century Commitment

**We design for 100 years.**

- Nock code written in 2025 will execute in 2125
- Verification proofs remain valid across hardware generations
- Knowledge accumulates (we don't relearn the same lessons every decade)

This is not utopian. It is **precedented**: Mathematical theorems proven in 1900 remain true in 2025. We apply the same principle to software.

## Nock Katas: Learning the Foundation

**To master Nock**, we provide progressive exercises:

### Kata 0: Tree Addressing
```nock
*[[42 17] 0 2] ‚Üí 42    # Get left branch
*[[42 17] 0 3] ‚Üí 17    # Get right branch
```

### Kata 1: Boolean Logic
```nock
# Encode: 0 = true, 1 = false (yes/no convention)
=[x x] ‚Üí 0   # Always true
=[x y] ‚Üí 1   # False (if x ‚â† y)
```

### Kata 2: Cons Lists
```nock
[1 [2 [3 0]]]  # List: (1 2 3)
# Like Lisp cons cells, but only atoms and cells
```

### Kata 3: If-Then-Else
```nock
*[a 6 test then else]
# Rule 6: Conditional execution
# If test ‚Üí 0 (yes): evaluate then
# If test ‚Üí 1 (no): evaluate else
```

## Community Covenant

**We commit**:

1. **To teach**: Nock shall be accessible, not arcane. We create educational materials, katas, tutorials.

2. **To verify**: Every major component shall have formal specifications and proofs (where tractable).

3. **To document**: Every design decision, every trade-off, every lesson learned shall be recorded for future generations.

4. **To preserve**: The grainhouse strategy ensures we control our dependencies, our toolchains, our destiny.

5. **To collaborate**: We contribute upstream when possible, but maintain forks when necessary for sovereignty.

## Conclusion: Building a Cathedral of Truth

**Most systems** are built on sand‚Äîshifting APIs, breaking ABIs, contradicting specs.

**We build on bedrock.**

Nock is small not because it's limited, but because it's **complete**‚Äîlike the axioms of arithmetic. Everything else is commentary.

**This constitution doesn't just answer**: "What is an init system?"

**It answers**: "What is a trustworthy foundation for civilization-scale software?"

**And the answer is**:

**12 rules, frozen in time, auditable by a child, verifiable by a sage, eternal by design.**

---

**The valley is not just a garden. It is a theorem.**

**We plant mathematical seeds. Future generations will harvest the forest.**
