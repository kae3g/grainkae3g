**Landscape** is a graphical web interface for your [ship](../ship). Right now, Landscape allows for social networking functions, such as to participating in IRC-like chats such as `~/~dopzod/urbit-help`, subscribing to forum-like pages of other ships called Notebooks, and message other ships directly. It also has weather and clock apps. Landscape is an alternative messaging interface to the command-line app [Chat](../chat).

Landscape can be accessed with a browser via [ship.arvo.network](../shiparvonetwork) or by `localhost:80`. You'll be greeted with a login prompt; type `+code` into your [Dojo](../dojo), and use the output as your password.
