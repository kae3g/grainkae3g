The **Galactic Senate** is the body of all [galaxies](../galaxy) that governs
[Azimuth](../azimuth) by [majority vote](../voting). There are two types of
votes: an [upgrade proposal](../upgrade), which is a motion to update the logic
of Azimuth (i.e. [Ecliptic](../ecliptic)), and a [document
proposal](../docvote), which is a motion to legitimize or approve the content of an
arbitrary document.
