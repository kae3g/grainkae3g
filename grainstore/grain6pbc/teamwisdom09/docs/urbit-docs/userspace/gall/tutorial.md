[**The Complete Guide to Gall and Userspace Apps on
Urbit**](https://github.com/timlucmiptev/gall-guide), or more colloquially
referred to as just "the Gall Guide," was contributed by a member of our
community named `~timluc-miptev`.

Our plan is ultimately to make this part of the official documentation found
here, but for now, know that it has our official seal of approval and is
actively maintained.
