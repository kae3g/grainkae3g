# 🌾 Grainrules-Vocab Design Document 🌾

**Module:** `grainrules-vocab`  
**Synonyms:** `grain-rules-vocab` • `grainvocab-rules` • `vocab-rules`  
**Type:** Template/Personal Separated  
**Depends On:** `grainrules`  
**Philosophy:** Simple vocabulary for clear communication

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**Grainrules-vocab** defines vocabulary constraints for the Grain Network, ensuring:

1. **10,000 Most Common English Words** - Base vocabulary list
2. **Zen Minimalist Refinements** - Stephen Mitchell-style simplicity
3. **Abstraction System** - Complex → Simple word mappings
4. **Vegan-Friendly Language** - Plant-based terminology
5. **G-Rated Content** - Family-friendly always

## 📚 The 10,000 Word List

**Primary Source:** Google's 10,000 Most Common English Words  
**URL:** https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english  
**License:** Public Domain (no copyright restrictions)  
**Validity:** Based on Google's trillion-word corpus  
**Acceptance:** Widely used in NLP, language learning, accessibility

**Secondary Sources for Validation:**
- MIT's Essential Words for the TOEFL (Academic standard)
- Oxford 3000™ (Oxford University Press)
- General Service List (Corpus linguistics)

---

## 🌸 Vocabulary Refinement Process

### Step 1: Base 10,000 Words

Load from `google-10000-english`:
```clojure
(def base-10k-words
  (-> "data/google-10000-english.txt"
      slurp
      str/split-lines
      set))
```

### Step 2: Remove Problematic Words

Filter out:
- Non-vegan terms (already in grainsource-vegan)
- Violent words
- Negative/aggressive terms
- Overly complex technical jargon

```clojure
(def problematic-words
  #{"kill" "dead" "die" "death" "slaughter" "butcher"
    "master" "slave" "blacklist" "whitelist"
    "violent" "attack" "weapon" "war" "fight"
    "hate" "angry" "rage" "fury"})

(def refined-10k-words
  (set/difference base-10k-words problematic-words))
```

### Step 3: Add Zen Minimalist Alternatives

Stephen Mitchell-style simple, clear, direct:

```clojure
(def zen-replacements
  {"difficult" "hard"
   "commence" "start"
   "terminate" "end"
   "utilize" "use"
   "acquire" "get"
   "sufficient" "enough"
   "demonstrate" "show"
   "approximately" "about"
   "consequently" "so"
   "nevertheless" "but"
   "furthermore" "also"
   "therefore" "thus"})
```

### Step 4: Create Abstraction Mappings

For words NOT in 10k, create simple equivalents:

```clojure
(def abstraction-map
  {;; Technical terms → Simple equivalents
   "transpiler" "code converter"
   "canister" "container"
   "cryptocurrency" "digital money"
   "blockchain" "chain of records"
   "repository" "code storage"
   
   ;; Complex → Simple
   "sophisticated" "advanced"
   "implementation" "building"
   "architecture" "structure"
   "paradigm" "pattern"
   "methodology" "method"
   
   ;; Grain-specific → Common
   "graintime" "time stamp"
   "grainpath" "file path"
   "graincard" "info card"
   "sheaf" "bundle"})
```

---

## 🌾 Rule System

### Vocabulary Validation Rule

```clojure
(ns grainrules-vocab.core
  (:require [grainrules.core :as rules]
            [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]
            [clojure.string :as str]
            [clojure.set :as set]))

(def vocab-10k-rule
  {:type :vocabulary-constraint
   :word-list "data/google-10000-english.txt"
   :refinements "data/zen-refinements.edn"
   :abstractions "data/abstraction-map.edn"
   :exceptions [:technical-terms :graindevnames :proper-nouns]
   :fallback-strategy :use-abstraction})

(defn word-in-vocab? [word vocab-set]
  (contains? vocab-set (str/lower-case word)))

(defn find-abstraction [word abstraction-map]
  (get abstraction-map (str/lower-case word)))

(defn validate-text [text]
  "Validate text against 10k word vocabulary with abstractions"
  (let [words (str/split text #"\s+")
        vocab (load-vocab-set)
        abstractions (load-abstractions)]
    (reduce
      (fn [result word]
        (cond
          (word-in-vocab? word vocab)
          (update result :valid conj word)
          
          (find-abstraction word abstractions)
          (update result :abstracted conj 
                  {:original word
                   :replacement (find-abstraction word abstractions)})
          
          :else
          (update result :unknown conj word)))
      {:valid [] :abstracted [] :unknown []}
      words)))
```

## 🌾 Stephen Mitchell Zen Principles

From his Tao Te Ching translation philosophy:

1. **Use Simple Words** - "use" not "utilize"
2. **Be Direct** - "start" not "commence"  
3. **Avoid Jargon** - "code converter" not "transpiler"
4. **One-Syllable Preference** - When possible, choose shorter
5. **Clear Over Clever** - Communication first, wit second

### Mitchell-Style Refinements

```clojure
(def mitchell-refinements
  {;; Complex → Simple (Mitchell style)
   "initiate" "start"
   "terminate" "end"
   "commence" "begin"
   "acquire" "get"
   "sufficient" "enough"
   "demonstrate" "show"
   "approximately" "about"
   "indicate" "show"
   "require" "need"
   "provide" "give"
   "enable" "let"
   "ensure" "make sure"
   "utilize" "use"
   "attempt" "try"
   "implement" "build"
   "modify" "change"
   "delete" "remove"
   "execute" "run"
   "configure" "set up"})
```

---

## 🌸 Rule Validation

### Word Validation Rule

```clojure
(s/def ::word
  (s/and string?
         #(word-in-10k? %)
         #(not (problematic-word? %))
         #(or (in-base-vocab? %)
              (has-abstraction? %))))

(s/def ::sentence
  (s/and string?
         #(all-words-valid? %)))

(s/def ::tri5h-response
  (s/keys :req-un [::greeting ::content ::sign-off]
          :opt-un [::haiku]))
```

### Emoji Rules

```clojure
(def ::emoji-rule
  {:type :emoji-constraint
   :allowed-emojis tri5h-emoji-vocab
   :max-per-line 3
   :placement [:end-of-sentence :standalone]
   :g-rated-only true})
```

---

## 💐 tri5h Application

### Before (Complex Vocabulary)

```
"Initiate the deployment process by executing the continuous integration pipeline,
then synchronize the modifications to the remote repository utilizing the
sophisticated version control methodology."
```

### After (10k + Zen + Abstractions)

```
"Start the deploy process by running the build pipeline, then push the changes
to the remote code place using version control. 🚀"
```

Or even simpler (tri5h style):

```
"Babe, just run the build and push it! Like, the code's not gonna deploy itself,
sweetie. 🌱 Now go make it happen! 💖"
```

## 🌾 Integration with Grainas-Voice

```clojure
;; grainas-voice uses grainai-vocab
(ns grainas.voice.tri5h
  (:require [grainai-vocab.core :as vocab]
            [grainrules-vocab.core :as rules-vocab]))

(defn generate-response [input]
  (let [raw-response (generate-raw-response input)
        validated (vocab/validate-text raw-response)
        simplified (vocab/simplify validated)]
    (vocab/ensure-10k-compliance simplified)))
```

---

## 📖 Example Rules

### tri5h Personality Rule

```clojure
(def tri5h-personality-rule
  {:persona "tri5h"
   :vocabulary-constraint :10k-words
   :zen-refinement-level :high
   :abstraction-preference :metaphorical
   :special-additions [:vegan-nutrition-terms :feminine-flowery-words]
   :tone-requirements {:warmth :high
                       :directness :medium
                       :sass-level :medium-high}})
```

### Vegan Vocabulary Rule

```clojure
(def vegan-vocab-rule
  {:type :terminology-constraint
   :replacements {"master" "primary"
                  "slave" "secondary"
                  "eggs" "seeds"
                  "omelette" "frittata"}
   :nutrition-terms [:vegan-only :plant-based-only]
   :metaphors [:grain :plant :flower :seed]})
```

---

## 🌸 Abstraction System

### Technical Abstractions

For words outside 10k, create simple equivalents:

```clojure
(def technical-abstractions
  {;; Complex tech → Simple + metaphor
   "transpiler" "code converter (like translating recipes! 🌱)"
   "canister" "container (like a grain jar! 🌾)"
   "deterministic" "predictable (like tofu texture! 🍲)"
   "asynchronous" "runs separately (like slow cooker! 🍛)"
   "idempotent" "same result each time (like measuring cups! 🥛)"
   
   ;; Grain-specific → Common
   "graintime" "time stamp"
   "grainpath" "file path"  
   "graincard" "info card"
   "sheaf" "bundle"
   "grainclay" "custom setup"})
```

### Zen Abstractions (Stephen Mitchell Style)

```clojure
(def zen-abstractions
  {;; Wordy → Minimal
   "in order to" "to"
   "at this point in time" "now"
   "due to the fact that" "because"
   "in the event that" "if"
   "for the purpose of" "for"
   "by means of" "by"
   "with regard to" "about"
   
   ;; Passive → Active
   "it is recommended that" "use"
   "it should be noted" "note"
   "consideration should be given" "consider"})
```

## 💐 tri5h Vocabulary Guidelines

### What tri5h CAN Say (10k words)

```clojure
(def tri5h-approved-vocab
  {;; Greetings (all in 10k)
   :greetings ["honey" "sweetie" "darling" "babe" "love"]
   
   ;; Encouragement (all in 10k)
   :encouragement ["amazing" "beautiful" "wonderful" "great" "perfect"]
   
   ;; Sass (all in 10k, kept simple)
   :sass ["seriously" "really" "actually" "like" "just"]
   
   ;; Nutrition (vegan, in 10k)
   :nutrition ["kale" "grain" "plant" "seed" "food" "healthy" "vitamin"]
   
   ;; Tech (simplified to 10k)
   :tech ["code" "program" "computer" "file" "build" "test" "push"]})
```

### What tri5h CANNOT Say (Outside 10k)

Must use abstractions:

```clojure
(def tri5h-abstraction-needed
  {"transpiler" → "code converter"
   "canister" → "container"
   "repository" → "code place"
   "deployment" → "putting it live"
   "asynchronous" → "runs in background"})
```

## 🌱 Philosophy

### Why 10,000 Words?

- **Accessibility** - Everyone understands common words
- **Clarity** - Simple > complex always
- **Zen Minimalism** - Less is more (Stephen Mitchell)
- **Vegan-Friendly** - Most common words are already plant-neutral
- **G-Rated** - Common words are family-friendly
- **International** - Common words easier for non-native speakers

### Why Abstractions?

Sometimes you need technical terms! But you can explain them simply:

"transpiler" → "code converter (like translating recipes! 🌱)"

The abstraction:
1. Uses simple 10k words
2. Adds a metaphor (tri5h style!)
3. Includes helpful emoji
4. Teaches while communicating

## 🚀 Deployment

### Data Files Required

```
data/
├── google-10000-english.txt          # Base 10k word list
├── zen-refinements.edn               # Mitchell-style simplifications
├── abstraction-map.edn               # Complex → Simple mappings
├── problematic-words.edn             # Words to filter
└── vegan-replacements.edn            # Vegan terminology
```

### Usage

```bash
# Validate text
bb vocab validate "your text here"

# Simplify text
bb vocab simplify "complex technical jargon"

# Check word
bb vocab check "transpiler"  
# Output: ❌ Not in 10k. Abstraction: "code converter"

# Analyze persona
bb vocab analyze tri5h
# Output: 94.2% coverage, 5.8% abstracted
```
