  "Solar House Clock system based on Sun's diurnal motion
  
  The Solar House Clock divides the day into 12 houses based on the Sun's position:
  
  - 1st House (Ascendant/ASC): Sunrise
  - 10th House (Midheaven/MC): Solar Noon (Sun at highest point)
  - 7th House (Descendant/DSC): Sunset
  - 4th House (Imum Coeli/IC): Solar Midnight (Sun at lowest point)
  
  Houses between these cardinal points are calculated as equidistant divisions:
  - 1st ‚Üí 10th: Morning houses (2nd, 3rd, houses rise to noon)
  - 10th ‚Üí 7th: Afternoon houses (11th, 8th, 9th descend to sunset)
  - 7th ‚Üí 4th: Evening houses (6th, 5th descend to midnight)
  - 4th ‚Üí 1st: Night houses (3rd, 2nd, 1st rise to sunrise)
  
  This system is independent of natal charts and purely based on solar time."
