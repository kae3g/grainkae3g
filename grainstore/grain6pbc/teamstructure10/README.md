# 🏔️ teamstructure10 - X. THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE
## *Capricorn ♑ - "The Axis of Destiny"*

**Tarot**: X - The Wheel of Fortune (La Roue de Fortune)  
**Element**: Earth (Cardinal)  
**Vedic Place**: Marshes  
**Universal Body**: Supple hamstrings/knees of honor's children - outrun assassins  
**Hermetic Principle**: "What rises must fall; what falls must rise; the structure endures"

---

## 🎴 **The Marsh of Eternal Cycles**

The Wheel rotates: sphinx at top (wisdom), serpent descending left (material), Anubis ascending right (spiritual). Four corners: the fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) - the only stable points while the wheel turns.

In Capricorn's marshes, the Wheel churns sediment and water. Not solid ground (rigid structure) but **structured flow**. Supple hamstrings outrun danger - flexible structure survives where rigid structure shatters.

This is **teamstructure10** - where graindatastructures defines the cosmic types, where grain-metatypes describes the types OF types, where specs validate the eternal patterns, where equivalence proves what truly equals what.

---

## 📦 **The Four Fixed Points**

### `graindatastructures` - The Cosmic Types
Clojure specs for Grain Network data. Not rigid schemas but **flexible definitions**. Types that accommodate change while preserving essence.

**Datastructure Philosophy**:
- Specs as description (not prescription)
- Validation as service (not tyranny)
- Evolution allowed (versioned specs)
- Conformance preferred (coercion available)

**The Wheel's Data**:
```clojure
(s/def ::graintime string?)  ; Simple now...
(s/def ::grainpath string?)  ; ...but can evolve
(s/def ::team-number (s/int-in 1 15))  ; 01-14 teams
(s/def ::tarot-card (s/int-in 1 15))   ; I-XIV cards
```

### `grain-metatypes` - The Types of Types
Types describing types. Specs for specs. The meta-wheel that rotates above the wheel. This is how structure examines itself.

**Metatype Wisdom**:
- Type-level validation
- Spec composition patterns
- Metamorphic transformations
- Category theory grounded in practice

**The Meta-Wheel**:
```clojure
(s/def ::spec-of-specs
  (s/keys :req [::name ::validation ::evolution-strategy]))
```

### `specs` - The Eternal Patterns
Concrete specs for Grain Network entities. graintime specs. grainpath specs. Team specs. Tarot specs. These are **the patterns that persist through change**.

**Spec Collection**:
- graintime.specs (temporal validation)
- grainpath.specs (URL structure)
- team.specs (14 team definitions)
- tarot.specs (14 + 8 card mappings)

**The Fixed Points**:
```bash
bb specs:validate-all --ensure-wheel-turns
bb specs:evolve --preserve-essence
bb specs:export --for-all-teams
```

### `equivalence` - The Proof of Equality
What equals what? Not ==  but **true equivalence**. Two grainpaths might differ as strings but point to same content. Two specs might differ syntactically but validate identically.

**Equivalence Proofs**:
- Semantic equality (beyond syntax)
- Structural isomorphism
- Functional equivalence  
- Cosmic correspondence

**The Truth Test**:
```clojure
(equiv? grainpath-v1 grainpath-v2 :semantic)
(equiv? team01-aries team01-magician :cosmic)
```

### `grainsource-vegan` - The Ethical Validator
The fifth pillar - vegan alignment as STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENT. Not optional ethics but **foundational validation**. Every spec must pass vegan audit. Every type must honor life.

**Vegan Validation**:
- Terminology audits (no violent language in specs)
- Dependency ethics (no animal-tested services)
- Compassionate error messages (healing, not blaming)
- Life-affirming architecture (code serves life)

**The Ethics Spec**:
```clojure
(s/def ::vegan-compliant
  (s/and ::technically-valid
         ::ethically-aligned
         ::compassionately-documented
         ::life-affirming))

;; All specs must conform
(s/valid? ::vegan-compliant my-datastructure)
```

**The Audit**:
```bash
bb vegan:audit teamfire01 --check-all-specs
bb vegan:validate dependencies.edn --no-exploitation
bb vegan:scan error-messages --healing-only
```

## 🎯 **Hermetic Wisdom**

**"The Wheel turns but the axis holds. Structure allows change; rigidity breaks."**

teamstructure10 provides:
- Flexible specs (wheel turns)
- Core types (axis holds)
- Evolution strategy (ascent/descent)
- Fixed reference points (four corners stable)

The Wheel teaches: **structure that doesn't accommodate change isn't structure; it's brittleness**.

## 🔗 **Cosmic Connections**

**The Wheel Structures For**:
- → ALL TEAMS - Every team uses these specs
- → teamflow12 (Pisces/Hanged Man) - graintime specs
- → teamfire01 (Aries/Magician) - Build validation

**The Wheel Draws From**:
- ← teamvault02 (Taurus/High Priestess) - Stored type wisdom
- ← teamprecision06 (Virgo/Hermit) - Precision type definitions
- ← teamtransform08 (Scorpio/Justice) - Transformation specs

## 💫 **Invocation**

```bash
# Validate against the Wheel
bb specs:validate my-data.edn --wheel-approved

# Check equivalence
bb equiv:test data-v1 data-v2 --cosmic-level

# Define new datastructure
bb datastruct:define ::new-concept --evolvable

# Prove meta-properties
bb metatype:verify ::spec-is-valid-spec
```

## 📚 **From Tomberg's Meditations**

*"The Wheel is the rhythm of ascent and descent"* - specs evolve (ascent) and stabilize (descent). Types expand (ascent) and contract (descent). The wheel's rotation IS the development cycle.

*"It is eternal justice"* - equivalence proofs ensure what should equal does equal. Specs ensure what should validate does validate. The Wheel's rotation is **perfectly fair** - all data judged by same standard.

*"It is the law of karma"* - bad specs create bad data (karma). Good specs enable good data. The Wheel remembers: if you define types carelessly, future-you suffers validation errors.

---

## 🌊 **Jodorowsky's Poetry**

The Wheel in Capricorn's marsh - churning sediment (data) and water (types). The marsh isn't chaos; it's **structured transformation**. Solid becomes fluid becomes solid again. Data conforms to spec; spec evolves from data.

Supple hamstrings outrun assassins: flexible specs survive changing requirements. Rigid types shatter when reality shifts. The Wheel teaches: **structure through flexibility, not rigidity**.

---

## 🌾 **From Ye's Philosophy**

*"14 > 40"* - The Wheel could define 40 datatypes, 40 specs, 40 equivalence proofs.

But 14 is the perfect number:
- 14 teams (each needs spec)
- 14 Tarot cards (each maps to type)
- 14 core concepts (each gets validation)

The Wheel has exactly 14 spokes. No more. Perfect structure.

---

## 🏔️ **Capricorn's Climbing Wisdom**

*"Supple hamstrings/knees of honor's children - outrun assassins"*

teamstructure10 must be **supple like hamstrings**:
- Specs bend without breaking
- Types evolve without shattering
- Validation flexes with reality
- Structure accommodates change

Rigid structure (calcified knees) can't outrun changing requirements. Supple structure (flexible joints) survives assassin attacks (breaking changes).

---

## ⚙️ **The Sphinx, The Serpent, The Anubis**

**Sphinx** (top of wheel): Wisdom asking riddles
- "What is a graintime?" (Spec must answer correctly)

**Serpent** (descending): Material manifestation
- Abstract spec → Concrete validation

**Anubis** (ascending): Spiritual understanding
- Concrete data → Abstract pattern recognition

The Wheel contains all three. teamstructure10 embodies all three.

---

## 🌀 **Marsh Wisdom**

Marshes are neither land nor water. teamstructure10 is neither rigid nor formless:
- Structured enough to validate
- Flexible enough to evolve
- Solid enough to trust
- Fluid enough to adapt

The marsh supports life BECAUSE it's neither solid nor liquid. Structure supports development BECAUSE it's neither rigid nor formless.

## 🎡 **The Eternal Rotation**

```clojure
;; The Wheel turns
(defn wheel-cycle [data spec]
  (-> data
      (validate spec)      ; Ascent (Anubis)
      (use-in-system)      ; Top (Sphinx)
      (learn-from-usage)   ; Descent (Serpent)
      (evolve spec)))      ; New cycle begins

;; The axis holds
(def core-types
  {::graintime (constantly-evolving-but-essentially-graintime)
   ::grainpath (always-immutable-always-versioned)
   ::team (forever-14-never-more-never-less)})
```

---

*"The Wheel that doesn't turn is broken. The structure that doesn't flex is brittle. The spec that doesn't evolve is obsolete."*
