---

## 🦀 HIGH PRIORITY (Start Immediately)

### 1. **grain-rust-utils** (Cargo Workspace Foundation)
**Timeline**: Week 1-2  
**Purpose**: Template Cargo workspace for ALL Rust development

**Deliverables**:
```
grain-rust-utils/
├── Cargo.toml              # Workspace definition
├── README.md               # Rust foundation guide
├── crates/
│   ├── grain-core/         # Core utilities
│   ├── grain-types/        # Type definitions
│   ├── grain-io/           # I/O utilities

└── docs/
    ├── CARGO-GUIDE.md      # How to use workspace
    └── RUST-LEARNING.md    # glo0w's Rust teaching plan
```

**Why First**: Foundation for everything else. Once workspace exists, all Rust projects use it.

---

### 2. **graindroid** (Android Cursor Clone)
**Timeline**: Week 3-6  
**Purpose**: Cursor/Void-like IDE for Android tablets (especially Daylight)

**Deliverables**:

```

**Subset Features** (Dante's layers):
- **INFERNO** (Must have): def, fn, let, if, basic collections
- **PURGATORIO** (Nice to have): map, filter, reduce, atoms
- **PARADISO** (Luxury): Macros, metadata, protocols

**Memory Strategy** (no GC):
- Compile-time lifetime analysis (borrow Rust's ideas)
- Arena allocation (allocate, use, free whole arena)
- Stack-only for hot paths
- *This is the HARD part - the warrior's true challenge*

---

## 📱 THE DAYLIGHT PATH (Your Immediate Need)

### Phase 1: **graindroid** (Cursor Clone)
**Target**: Daylight Computer tablet  
**Founder**: Anjan Katta (your friend!)  
**Use Case**: Code during long sessions without eye strain

**Tech Stack Decision**:
```
Option A: Kotlin + Rust
├─ Pro: Fast to market, good Android integration
├─ Con: Less Rust practice
└─ Recommendation: ★★★★☆ (BEST for shipping fast)

Option B: Pure Rust
├─ Pro: Maximum Rust learning
├─ Con: Android integration harder
└─ Recommendation: ★★★☆☆ (better for learning)

Option C: React Native + Rust modules
├─ Pro: Fastest development
├─ Con: Less native feel
└─ Recommendation: ★★☆☆☆ (prototype only)
```

**Glow's Recommendation**: Option A (Kotlin + Rust)
- Ship working app in 2-3 months
- Incrementally rewrite hot paths in Rust
- Learn Rust while having usable tool
- *The warrior ships, then perfects*

---

### Phase 2: **Framework + Daylight Collaboration**
**Participants**:
- **Anjan Katta** (Daylight Computer - display tech)
- **Nirav Patel** (Framework - modular laptop)
- **You** (kae3g - the connector!)

**Vision**: Daylight e-ink display AS Framework module!

**Controlled Folly**: Act as if this collab is guaranteed.  
**Nagual Truth**: It might not happen.  
**Warrior's Way**: Build relationships + prototype anyway.

**Steps**:
1. Add Anjan to graincontacts (personal connection)
2. Use Daylight tablet extensively (become power user)
3. Build graindroid (prove you're serious developer)
4. Document Framework + Daylight workflow
5. Propose to both: "Daylight display as Framework module"
6. *If yes: collaborate. If no: learned valuable Rust anyway*

## 🌾 GRAIN-EMBEDDED TIMELINE (The Long Game)

### Year 1 (12026): Research & Design
- Study existing embedded Lisps (Ferret, uLisp, etc.)
- Design Clojure subset for embedded
- Prototype compiler in Rust
- Target: Blink LED in Clojure syntax

### Year 2 (12027): Implementation
- Build minimal runtime (no GC!)
- Implement core forms (def, fn, let, if)
- Add basic collections (vector, map - maybe)
- Target: Read sensor, send MQTT in Clojure

### Year 3 (12028): Ecosystem
- Standard library for embedded
- Common device drivers
- grain-IoT network protocol
- Target: Deploy 100 grain sensors running Clojure

**Why Worth It**:
- IoT needs better languages (C is dangerous for sensors)
- Grain Network could have physical presence (sensors in farms, forests)
- Educational (students learn embedded + functional together)
- Nobody else doing this (blue ocean)

## 🌑 NAGUAL WARNINGS (What Could Go Wrong)

**Scope Creep** (40 not 14):
- Don't try to build EVERYTHING at once
- Focus on graindroid FIRST
- Other research is PARALLEL, not blocking

**Perfectionism** (Angel without Jaguar):
- Ship graindroid MVP even if imperfect
- Iterate based on real usage
- The warrior acts, doesn't just plan

**Shiny Object** (Rahu's seduction):
- Don't chase every new Rust crate
- Don't rewrite working Clojure in Rust "because Rust"
- Only rewrite when it ENABLES something new

**Analysis Paralysis** (Studying forever):
- 3 months max for research phases
- Then: Build or abandon
- Don't research seL4 for 2 years - decide in 3 months

---

## 🎩 THE WARRIOR'S COMMITMENT

*~stares with Don Juan intensity~*

Yo G, here's my pact with you:

**I will teach you Rust** the nagual way:
- Not through tutorials (tonal learning)
- But through BUILDING graindroid (nagual doing)
- Every error: a seeing
- Every fix: a power recapitulation
- 6 months: you'll have "the click"

**I will guide you through foundations**:
- RISC-V (the open ISA)
- Redox/seL4 (the kernel quest)
- musl (the minimal libc)
- Embedded Clojure (the long game)

**I will maintain warrior discipline**:
- Focus on HIGH priority (graindroid)
- Research in parallel (RISC-V, OS)
- Ship before perfect (controlled folly)
- Stay alert to nagual (opportunities in void)

**Deal, warrior?** 🤝

---
