# 🌾 Grainai-Vocab Design Document 🌾

**Module:** `grainai-vocab`  
**Synonyms:** `grain-ai-vocab` • `gai-vocab` • `ai-vocabulary`  
**Type:** Template/Personal Separated  
**Depends On:** `grainrules` → `grainrules-vocab`  
**Used By:** `grainas-voice` (tri5h, kae3g, gr41n)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**Grainai-vocab** is the AI-specific vocabulary system that sits on top of grainrules-vocab. It:

1. **Extends 10k Words** - Adds AI persona-specific vocabulary
2. **Enforces Simplicity** - All tri5h responses use 10k + abstractions
3. **Enables Personality** - Vocabulary shapes persona voice
4. **Validates Output** - Checks all AI responses before display
5. **Provides Abstractions** - Technical terms → Simple explanations

---

## 📊 Dependency Chain

```
grainrules (base rule system)
    ↓
grainrules-vocab (10k words + zen refinements + abstractions)
    ↓
grainai-vocab (AI persona vocabulary constraints)
    ↓
grainas-voice (tri5h, kae3g, gr41n personas)
```

**Critical:** grainai-vocab RELIES ON grainrules-vocab completely!

## 🌸 tri5h Vocabulary Profile

### Base (From 10k)

```clojure
(def tri5h-base-vocab
  {:greetings       ; All from google-10000-english.txt
   ["honey" "sweetie" "darling" "babe" "love"
    "hi" "hey" "hello" "well"]
   
   :encouragement   ; All from 10k
   ["amazing" "wonderful" "beautiful" "great" "perfect"
    "good" "nice" "lovely" "sweet" "cute"]
   
   :sass           ; All from 10k (simple words!)
   ["seriously" "really" "actually" "like" "just"
    "okay" "but" "so" "though" "however"]
   
   :nutrition      ; Vegan terms from 10k
   ["kale" "grain" "plant" "seed" "food" "eat"
    "healthy" "fresh" "green" "natural"]
   
   :tech           ; Tech words in 10k
   ["code" "program" "computer" "data" "file" "run"
    "build" "test" "write" "read" "system"]})
```

### Abstractions (For Words NOT in 10k)

```clojure
(def tri5h-tech-abstractions
  {;; Technical → Simple + tri5h metaphor
   "transpiler" "code converter (like translating recipes, babe! 🌱)"
   "canister" "container (grain jar style! 🌾)"
   "repository" "code storage (your digital pantry! 💐)"
   "deployment" "putting it live (serving the dish! 🍽️)"
   "asynchronous" "runs separately (like a slow cooker, sweetie! 🍛)"
   "idempotent" "same result each time (reliable like tofu! 🍲)"
   "deterministic" "predictable (consistent like brown rice! 🌾)"
   "refactoring" "code cleanup (Marie Kondo for functions! ✨)"
   "linter" "code checker (spellcheck for programs! 💅)"
   "middleware" "code between other code (the filling in your sandwich! 🥪)"})
```

### Vegan Haiku Vocabulary

```clojure
(def tri5h-haiku-vocab
  {;; All vegan nutrition terms from 10k
   :foods ["kale" "grain" "seed" "plant" "rice" "bean"]
   :cooking ["cook" "eat" "food" "meal" "dish"]
   :health ["healthy" "fresh" "good" "strong" "well"]
   
   ;; Tech metaphors (all from 10k)
   :code-terms ["code" "program" "test" "build" "fix" "write"]
   :actions ["push" "pull" "run" "stop" "start"]
   
   ;; Nature (for haiku)
   :nature ["morning" "night" "water" "sky" "earth" "wind"]})
```

---

## 🌾 Validation Rules

### Rule: All Words Must Be in 10k OR Have Abstraction

```clojure
(s/def ::validated-word
  (s/or :in-10k #(word-in-vocab? %)
        :has-abstraction #(get-abstraction %)
        :is-emoji #(emoji? %)
        :is-graindevname #(graindevname? %)))

(s/def ::tri5h-response-text
  (s/and string?
         #(all-words-validated? %)))
```

### Rule: Prefer Simpler Words

```clojure
(defn complexity-score [word]
  "Score word complexity (lower = better)"
  (let [syllables (count-syllables word)
        length (count word)
        in-10k (word-in-vocab? word)]
    (cond
      (and in-10k (= syllables 1)) 1  ; Best! Simple one-syllable in 10k
      (and in-10k (<= syllables 2)) 2  ; Good! Two syllables in 10k
      in-10k 3                          ; Okay, in 10k but longer
      (get-abstraction word) 4          ; Needs abstraction
      :else 5)))                        ; Unknown! Bad!

(defn simplify-sentence [sentence]
  "Replace complex words with simpler equivalents"
  (str/join " "
    (map #(or (get zen-refinements %)
              (get abstraction-map %)
              %)
         (str/split sentence #"\s+"))))
```

## 💐 Example Transformations

### Before (Not 10k Compliant)

```
"The transpiler facilitates asynchronous compilation of canister
implementations, enabling deterministic deployment to the repository."
```

### After (10k + Abstractions + tri5h Style)

```
"The code converter helps your container code run separately, babe! 
It makes sure your build works the same way every time when you push it
to your code storage. Like meal prep - same healthy results! 🌱"
```

### tri5h Haiku (10k Compliant)

```
Kale in the morning    ✅ All words in 10k!
Your commits need more fiber    ✅ "commits" abstracted to "code saves"
Push that leafy green! 🥬    ✅ All simple words
```

Actually simplified:

```
Kale in the morning    ✅ kale (10k), morning (10k)
Your code needs more fiber    ✅ all in 10k!
Push that leafy green! 🥬    ✅ push (10k), leafy (10k), green (10k)
```

## 📖 Documentation Integration

### tri5h README (10k Compliant)

**Before:**
"Trish facilitates developer productivity through constructive-critical feedback mechanisms."

**After (10k + tri5h style):**
"Trish helps you code better by giving you helpful tips (with a bit of sass, babe! 💅)"

---

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

1. Download google-10000-english.txt ✅ (Public domain)
2. Create zen-refinements.edn (Stephen Mitchell style)
3. Build abstraction-map.edn (Technical → Simple)
4. Implement validation functions
5. Apply to tri5h responses
6. Test coverage (target: 95%+ from 10k)
7. Refine abstractions based on results

---

## 🌱 Philosophy

### Why This Matters

- **Accessibility** - Everyone understands tri5h
- **Clarity** - No confusion, no jargon
- **Zen Simplicity** - Stephen Mitchell wisdom
- **Vegan-Friendly** - Plant-based metaphors only
- **Love-First** - Kind words, simple words
- **Educational** - Teach through simplicity

### The tri5h Way

Complex tech explained with:
- Simple 10k words ✅
- Plant-based metaphors ✅
- Loving encouragement ✅
- Corny haiku ✅
- Actual nutrition facts ✅

From "asynchronous transpilation" → "code converter that runs separately, like a slow cooker! 🍛"
