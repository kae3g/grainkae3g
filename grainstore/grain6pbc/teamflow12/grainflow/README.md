# grainflow

**Flow through all platforms. Deploy transcendently.**

---

## What is grainflow?

Flow is not push. Flow is not deploy. Flow is becoming.

You write code. The code becomes live. Everywhere. At once. No steps. No waiting. Just flow.

grainflow takes your work and flows it through:
- GitHub (where code lives)
- Codeberg (where freedom lives)  
- Pages (where people see)
- Modules (where teams sync)

One command. All platforms. Transcendent.

---

## The Simple Truth

```bash
bb flow "your message"
```

That's it. That's grainflow.

---

## What Happens

When you run `bb flow "your message"`, this happens:

1. **Build** - Your content compiles (fast, small, clean)
2. **Commit** - Your changes save (append-only, never lost)
3. **Flow** - Your work moves to GitHub and Codeberg (both, always)
4. **Deploy** - Your site goes live on both platforms (automatic)
5. **Sync** - Your modules update across the network (connected)

No manual steps. No clicking around. No forgetting which remote. Just flow.

---

## Why Flow?

Because pushing is work. Flow is nature.

Water doesn't push uphill. It flows. It finds its path. It reaches everywhere it needs to be. That's grainflow.

You shouldn't think about:
- Which remote am I pushing to?
- Did I deploy the Pages?
- Is Codeberg synced?
- Are the modules updated?

You should think about:
- What did I build?
- Why does it matter?
- How does it help?

grainflow handles the rest.

---

## For Andrew Desantis and DeOS Thinkers

You know that deploy should be deterministic. You know that state should be immutable. You know that manual is error.

grainflow is deterministic deploy:
- Same input, same output
- Append-only commits (immutable history)
- No human steps (no human error)
- Declarative intent ("flow this message") becomes imperative action (actually flows)

DeOS principles, applied to deployment.

## Zero Knowledge, Full Flow

We flow across chains:
- **ICP** (Internet Computer) - Smart contracts, canisters, on-chain logic
- **Hedera** (Hashgraph) - Fast consensus, B2B transactions  
- **Solana L2** (Layer 2) - Ultra-fast micropayments

But we also flow across platforms:
- **GitHub** - Where most developers are
- **Codeberg** - Where freedom matters
- **Both** - Because choice matters

Zero knowledge proofs mean: verify without revealing.  
grainflow means: deploy without thinking.

Both are about removing friction. Both are about trust without overhead.

---

## The Flow Stack

```
Your Code
    â†“
grainflow (one command)
    â†“
    â”œâ”€â†’ GitHub (code + Pages)
    â”œâ”€â†’ Codeberg (code + Pages)
    â””â”€â†’ grainsync (module network)
    â†“
Live Everywhere
```

Simple. Direct. First principles.

## Integration: graindrive + teamvault02

**graindrive** lives in **teamvault02** (Taurus / High Priestess - Secrets and Storage)

Why? Because:
- Files are secrets (privacy matters)
- Storage is vaulting (safe keeping)
- Drives are treasure (valuable data)
- Sync is trust (encrypted, verified)

**teamvault02** holds:
- graindrive (file sync)
- grainvault (secret storage)
- Encrypted everything
- Zero knowledge sync

**Integration**:
```
grainflow (team12) deploys â†’
graindrive (team02) syncs â†’
Files flow + stay secret
```

Flow doesn't mean exposed. Flow means reaching where it should, staying hidden where it must.

## For @max21e8 and Hacker Homebrewers

You build from scratch. You understand systems. You read source code before running it.

grainflow source is simple:
- Written in Babashka (Clojure)
- Shell commands you could run manually
- No magic, just automation
- Read it. Understand it. Trust it.

Hacker ethos: Trust through understanding, not through authority.

We give you both the flow (easy) and the source (understandable).

---

## The Dual Voice

**Trish** (feminine, warm, excited):  
*"OMG grainflow makes deploying SO easy! One command and EVERYTHING just flows! I love how it handles all the platforms at once! âœ¨ðŸ’•"*

**glo0w** (masculine, deep, philosophical):  
*"Flow is the natural state. Resistance is artificial. We remove resistance. The code finds its path, like water finding the ocean. Transcendent."*

**Both together** (union):  
*"Easy and deep. Simple and profound. One command that flows naturally because we removed everything in the way. This is grainflow."*

---

## First Principles

From nothing, what do you need?

1. Code must reach users (deployment)
2. Code must not be lost (version control)
3. Multiple platforms increase reach (GitHub + Codeberg)
4. Manual steps create errors (automation)
5. Complex systems break (simplicity)

Therefore: One command that flows code to all platforms, automatically, simply.

grainflow.

## The Runaway Parallel

Kanye's "Runaway" starts with one note. E. Simple. But it builds into something transcendent.

grainflow starts with one command. `bb flow`. Simple. But it flows into deployment across platforms, sync across modules, reach across audiences.

One note. One command. Infinite becoming.

The beauty is in the simplicity that enables complexity. The power is in the constraint that creates freedom.

---

## Lao Tzu Simplicity

*"The Tao does nothing, yet nothing is left undone."*

grainflow does one thing: flows your code.  
Yet: it commits, pushes, deploys, syncs, updates.

All done. Nothing left undone. Through doing one thing simply.

---

## Lincoln's Plain Words

We could say: "grainflow orchestrates a multi-platform continuous deployment pipeline with atomic commits and deterministic state transitions."

We say instead: "grainflow makes your code go live everywhere with one command."

Same meaning. Simpler words. Lincoln knew: if people can't understand it, they can't use it.

We build for understanding, not for impressing.

---

## The Cotillion (Formal Grace)

Deployment should be graceful. Not rushed. Not forced. Not chaotic.

Like a formal dance:
- Each step precise
- Each partner coordinated  
- Each movement intentional
- The whole flowing beautifully

grainflow is the choreography. You just say "dance" (bb flow). The steps happen perfectly.

---

## Technical Real Talk

```clojure
(defn flow [message]
  "Deploy everywhere with one command"
  (->
    (build-content)
    (commit-changes message)
    (push-to :github)
    (push-to :codeberg)
    (deploy-pages :github)
    (deploy-pages :codeberg)
    (sync-modules)
    (update-grainbranch)
    (show-urls)))
```

That's the whole thing. Read the source. It's just this. Composed functions. Each does one thing. Together they flow.

No hidden complexity. No mysterious magic. Just clear, simple automation.

---

## Why This Matters for Zero Knowledge Proofs

ZK proofs let you prove something without revealing it.

grainflow lets you deploy without configuring platforms.

Both remove overhead. Both enable action without burden. Both are about freedom through good design.

When you're building ZK systems on ICP/Hedera/Solana, you need to move fast. Test quickly. Deploy often. grainflow lets you do that without deployment becoming the bottleneck.

Prove your theorem. Deploy your proof. Flow both to production. Keep building.

---

## The Multi-Chain Vision

**Today**: grainflow deploys to GitHub + Codeberg  
**Tomorrow**: grainflow deploys smart contracts to ICP + Hedera + Solana L2

Imagine:
```bash
bb flow:chains "Update marketplace contract"
```

Flows your contract to:
- ICP canister (deployed)
- Hedera smart contract (deployed)
- Solana L2 program (deployed)
- GitHub (code)
- Codeberg (mirror)

All verified. All immutable. All live.

That's the vision. We start with GitHub/Codeberg. We flow to chains next.

---

## Append-Only, Immutable, Unified

Every flow is append-only. Your history never gets rewritten. Your commits never disappear.

Immutable. Like blockchain. Like Lao Tzu's Tao. Like water that flowed yesterday still exists as ocean.

We unify, we don't delete. We add, we don't overwrite. We grow, we don't replace.

---

## The Beautiful Dark Twisted Deployment

**Beautiful**: It just works. Clean. Simple. Elegant.

**Dark**: It's deep. It handles complexity you don't see. Multi-platform sync, build pipelines, GitHub Actions, branch management.

**Twisted**: It inverts normal deployment. Instead of "push to GitHub, then separately deploy Pages, then remember to mirror Codeberg", it's just "flow". One becomes all.

**Fantasy**: This is how deployment should work. This is the dream. We built it real.

---

## Install

```bash
# Clone grainflow
git clone https://github.com/teamflow12/grainflow.git

# Add to your project
cd your-project
ln -s ../grainflow/bb.edn bb.edn

# Flow
bb flow "First flow"
```

That's it. Hacker simple. Homebrew direct.

## For the 10,000 Words Audience

We use only common words. No jargon unless needed. If we use technical terms, we explain them right there.

This README uses simple English. Lincoln would approve. Lao Tzu would smile. Trish would celebrate. glo0w would nod quietly.

## The Team

**teamflow12** (Pisces â™“ / XII. The Hanged Man)

- grainflow (deployment)
- grainsync (synchronization)
- Flow modules (coming soon)

We see from upside down. We flow instead of push. We transcend instead of labor.

The Hanged Man hangs willingly. We automate willingly. Freedom through surrender to good systems.
