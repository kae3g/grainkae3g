**Deploy everywhere. One command. Transcendent flow.**

---

## What

Flow code to all platforms at once. GitHub. Codeberg. Pages. Modules. Synchronized.

---

## How

```bash
bb flow "message"
```

Done.

---

## Why

Ten steps become one. Complexity becomes simple. Push becomes flow.

---

## Flow

Water doesn't push. It flows. Code should too.

---

## Build

Compile content. Fast. Incremental. Small.

---

## Commit

Save changes. Append-only. Immutable. Forever.

---

## GitHub

Code platform. Most users. Network effect. Integrated tools.

---

## Codeberg

Freedom platform. Non-profit. Ethical. Privacy-respecting.

---

## Pages

Both platforms host websites. Both update automatically. Both live.

---

## Sync

Modules connect. Teams share. Network unifies.

---

## One

One command. All platforms. No steps forgotten. No time wasted.

---

## Zero Knowledge

Prove without revealing. Deploy without configuring. Flow without friction.

---

## DeOS

Deterministic. Immutable. Composable. Declarative. Principles applied.

---

## Chains

Today: GitHub + Codeberg.  
Tomorrow: ICP + Hedera + Solana L2.  
Same flow.

---

## Trust

Read source. Understand. Choose. Trust through knowledge, not authority.

---

## Vault

**graindrive** (teamvault02) flows files. Encrypted. Safe. Private.

---

## Hanged Man

See upside down. Flow instead of push. Transcend labor.

---

## Simple

Lincoln's words. Lao Tzu's way. One note. One command.

---

## Runaway

Start simple. Build layers. Complete beautifully. Don't rush.

---

## Promise

Append-only. Never delete. Always sync. Stay simple. Keep flowing.
