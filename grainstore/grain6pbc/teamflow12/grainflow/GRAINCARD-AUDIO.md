# grainflow

Put your code live. Everywhere. One simple command.

---

## What Grainflow Does

You type one thing. Your code goes to many places. All at once.

---

## The One Command

Type: `bb flow "your message"`

That's all. That's grainflow.

---

## Where It Goes

Your code flows to GitHub. And to Codeberg. And to live websites on both. And to shared modules.

All places. One command. Like water flowing down.

---

## Why This Helps

Old way: Ten different steps. Easy to forget. Takes time.

New way: One step. Can't forget. Saves time.

---

## Like Water

Water flows down a mountain. Finds every path. Reaches the ocean.

Code flows through grainflow. Finds every platform. Reaches every user.

---

## Never Lost

Every flow saves your work forever. Never deleted. Never gone. Always there.

Like writing in stone. But easier.

---

## Two Platforms

GitHub: Where most people are.  
Codeberg: Where freedom lives.

Both matter. Both get your code. Every time.

---

## Live Sites

Both make websites. Both update on their own. Both show your work.

---

## Shared Pieces

Other teams see your updates. Their tools stay fresh. Everyone connected.

---

## Simple On Purpose

One command. Easy words. Clear result.

Not by accident. By choice. Simple is better.

---

## Safe Files

Need to share files? graindrive handles that. Keeps them safe. Keeps them private.

---

## For Builders

Made for people who make things. Not for people who click buttons all day.

---

## The Promise

Will always: Save your work. Flow everywhere. Stay simple.

Will never: Delete history. Skip platforms. Get complex.
