# grainflow - Listen Version

**Picture water flowing down a mountain.**

That's what grainflow does with your code. You put it at the top. It flows down to everywhere it needs to be. GitHub. Codeberg. Live websites. All at once. Like water finding every stream, every river, all paths to the ocean.

---

## The Simple Idea

You make something. You want people to see it. You type one command. Everyone can see it.

That's grainflow.

---

## Before grainflow

Picture this old way:

You finish writing code. Now you have to remember:
1. Save the file
2. Add it to git
3. Write a commit message
4. Push to GitHub
5. Wait for that to finish
6. Push to Codeberg (if you remember)
7. Deploy to GitHub Pages
8. Deploy to Codeberg Pages
9. Update your modules
10. Update the branch settings

Ten steps. Easy to forget one. Easy to mess up. Easy to lose time.

---

## With grainflow

Picture the new way:

You finish writing code. You type:

```
bb flow "I made something cool"
```

Done. Everything happens. GitHub gets it. Codeberg gets it. Both websites update. Modules sync. Branch settings update.

One step. Can't forget. Can't mess up. Time saved for building.

---

## Why One Command Matters

Your brain has limited space. Every step you have to remember takes space. Every choice takes energy.

If deploy takes ten steps, your brain saves energy for those steps. That's energy not used for creating.

If deploy takes one step, your brain relaxes. All energy goes to creating.

Simple tools make smart people. Complex tools make tired people.

---

## How It Works (Simple Version)

Picture a water pipe with many outlets.

You pour water in at the top (your code).

The pipe splits into branches:
- One branch to GitHub
- One branch to Codeberg  
- One branch to Pages
- One branch to modules

Water flows to all branches at once. Not one by one. All together.

When water reaches each outlet, it arrives. Done.

That's grainflow. Pour once. Arrive everywhere.

---

## The Flow Idea

"Flow" is a word with deep meaning here.

In water terms: Flow means move without stopping, find the path, reach the destination.

In deploy terms: Flow means go from your computer to live websites without steps in between.

In life terms: Flow means doing work that feels natural, not forced.

All three meanings are true at once. That's why we call it grainflow, not graindeploy or grainpush.

## For People Who Like Understanding

If you want to know exactly what happens, here it is in order:

1. **Build Content**
   - Your markdown files become web pages
   - This uses a tool called Clelte
   - It's fast (only builds what changed)
   - It's small (removes extra stuff)

2. **Commit Changes**
   - Git saves what you changed
   - Uses your message ("I made something cool")
   - Append-only (never deletes old versions)
   - Creates immutable history

3. **Flow to GitHub**
   - Sends code to GitHub
   - GitHub stores it
   - GitHub triggers Actions (automatic build)

4. **Flow to Codeberg**
   - Sends code to Codeberg  
   - Codeberg stores it (backup + freedom)
   - Codeberg builds Pages

5. **Deploy Pages**
   - GitHub Pages: Your site at github.io
   - Codeberg Pages: Your site at codeberg.page
   - Both update automatically

6. **Sync Modules**
   - Updates connected pieces
   - Other teams see your changes
   - Network stays synchronized

7. **Update Settings**
   - Sets default branch
   - Updates description with live URL
   - Makes everything point to newest version

All of this from one command. That's automation done right.

---

## Why Multiple Platforms?

Good question. Why not just GitHub? Or just Codeberg?

Answer: Both matter, for different reasons.

**GitHub**: Where most developers are. Where most people look first. Where tools integrate. Network effect.

**Codeberg**: Non-profit. No corporate owner. Freedom-focused. Privacy-respecting. Ethical choice.

We don't choose one or the other. We choose both. Freedom AND reach. Ethics AND practicality.

The Lovers teach: Why choose when you can unite?

## The Multi-Chain Future

Right now: grainflow deploys to code platforms (GitHub, Codeberg).

Soon: grainflow deploys to blockchain platforms (ICP, Hedera, Solana L2).

Picture this future:

```
bb flow:chains "Update marketplace"
```

Your smart contract flows to:
- ICP canister (live)
- Hedera contract (live)
- Solana L2 program (live)
- All verified with zero knowledge proofs
- All deployed in seconds
- One command

That's where we're going. We start with code. We flow to chains.

---

## The Zero Knowledge Connection

Zero knowledge proofs let you prove you know something without showing what you know.

Example: Prove you're over 18 without showing your birth date. Prove you have money without showing your balance. Prove you solved the puzzle without showing the solution.

grainflow connects to this idea:

You prove your code works (it deploys successfully) without needing to understand deployment complexity (the proof is: it's live).

The deployment happens behind the scenes. You just see: it worked. The proof is the working website.

Zero knowledge about deployment complexity. Full knowledge that it worked.

---

## DeOS Philosophy Integration

Andrew Desantis built DeOS (Decentralized Operating System) on ideas of:
- Deterministic
- Immutable
- Composable
- Declarative

grainflow is all four:

**Deterministic**: Same command, same result, always.

**Immutable**: Append-only commits, never rewrite history.

**Composable**: Small functions (build, commit, push, deploy) composed into flow.

**Declarative**: You declare "flow this message", not "do these 10 steps".

We took DeOS principles and applied them to deployment. The result: grainflow.

## The Hanged Man's Wisdom

The Hanged Man (Tarot card 12) hangs upside down. He sees the world differently.

Normal thinking: Deployment is pushing code somewhere.

Hanged Man thinking: Deployment is code finding its natural resting places.

We don't push. We flow. The code wants to be on GitHub, Codeberg, Pages. We remove the obstacles. It flows there naturally.

Upside down perspective. Right-side up results.

## Storage and Secrets (teamvault02)

**graindrive** handles files. Sync them. Store them. Keep them safe.

Lives in **teamvault02** because:
- Taurus energy: Stable, solid, secure
- High Priestess: Secrets, hidden knowledge, what's kept private
- Vault: Treasure, protection, encryption

**Integration with grainflow**:

When you flow code, you might also flow files:
- Images for your site
- Data files for your app
- Config files for your tools

graindrive (team02) handles those files specially:
- Encrypted sync
- Version control
- Safe storage

grainflow (team12) flows the code and triggers graindrive (team02) for the files.

Separation of concerns. Each team does what it does best.

## For People Who Read Carefully

You might notice: This document uses simple words. Common words. Words you learned before high school.

That's on purpose. Smart ideas don't need complex words. Complex words often hide simple ideas (or no ideas at all).

We use simple words because we respect your time and your brain. We want you to understand quickly. Then build. Then flow.

If you need technical details, read the source code. It's commented. It's clear.

If you need the overview, read this. Simple words. Deep ideas.

## The Runaway Pattern

Kanye's "Runaway" has a pattern:
- Start simple (one note)
- Add layer by layer
- Build to something beautiful
- Let it play out (9 minutes!)
- Don't rush

grainflow follows this:
- Start simple (one command)
- Add platforms layer by layer (GitHub, Codeberg, Pages, sync)
- Build to full deployment
- Let it complete (automatic)
- Don't rush (takes 1-2 minutes, all automatic)

Patience in the build. Automation in the flow. Beauty in the result.

---

## My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (Deployment Edition)

**Beautiful**: Clean code, clear docs, simple commands.

**Dark**: Complex systems underneath (git, SSH, APIs, Actions).

**Twisted**: Inverts normal deploy (instead of many steps, one flow).

**Fantasy**: The dream of perfect deployment, made real.

grainflow is deployment reimagined. Like MBDTF reimagined hip-hop.

## What You Should Do

1. Read this document
2. Look at the source code (it's simple, I promise)
3. Try it once: `bb flow "my first flow"`
4. Watch it work
5. Use it forever

Don't overthink. Just flow.

---

## The Promise

grainflow will:
- Work the same way every time
- Show you what it's doing
- Never lose your code
- Never break your history
- Stay simple forever

This is the promise. We keep it.
