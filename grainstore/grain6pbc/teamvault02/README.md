# 🐂 grainvault - ♉ Taurus
## *"The Builder - Where Value Becomes Tangible"*

**Element**: Earth (Fixed)  
**Vedic Place**: Farms  
**Universal Body**: Zen "original face before your parents were born" - nourishment of first satori  
**Energy**: Grounded accumulation, sensory abundance, patient building

---

## 🌾 **The Farm That Feeds Forever**

Taurus transforms potential into produce, cloud into clay, drive into nourishment. The farm doesn't rush - it tends, it waters, it waits for the right season. This is Earth at its most patient and productive.

The "original face" - the self before conditioning, before birth, the pure essence that drives need for nourishment. First satori: the realization that storage is sacred, that accumulation serves, that what is saved today feeds tomorrow.

grainvault holds the storage layer - where files live, where clay hardens, where vendors gather, where the harvest is kept safe.

## 📦 **Consolidated Modules**

### `graindrive` - The Cloud Pasture
Google Drive integration for Grain Network. Files graze in the cloud, managed from the ground. Clojure-based API for drive operations.

**Drive Capabilities**:
- OAuth2 authentication
- File upload/download
- Folder management
- Metadata queries
- Sharing and permissions

### `grainclay` - The Hardening Earth
Clay as metaphor for data that solidifies over time. Archives, backups, long-term storage. What was liquid becomes permanent.

**Clay Functions**:
- Archive creation
- Compression strategies
- Checksum verification
- Restore procedures
- Temporal snapshots

### `grainclay-cleanup` - The Seasonal Harvest
Not all storage lasts forever. Old archives rot, old backups decay. Cleanup is cultivation. Pruning is care.

**Cleanup Strategies**:
- Time-based retention
- Size-based limits
- Deduplication
- Archive consolidation
- Graceful degradation

### `vendor` - The Market Square
Third-party dependencies, external libraries, tools that don't fit elsewhere. The vendors who bring goods to the farm.

**Vendor Contents**:
- External libraries
- Binary tools
- Reference implementations
- Curated dependencies

## 🎯 **Purpose & Philosophy**

**PLACE** (Mantreswara): Farms  
**BODY** (Phaladeepika): Original face - nourishment of first satori

The farm feeds the family. The vault protects the harvest. Storage is not hoarding - it's provision. The original face knows: hunger is real, nourishment is necessary, abundance is sacred.

Taurus energy is slow, deliberate, sensual. Touch the clay. Feel the files. Trust the process of accumulation. Fixed Earth doesn't move fast, but what it builds lasts.

First satori: the awakening to value. Not every file matters equally. Not every backup deserves eternal life. Curation is wisdom. Cleanup is cultivation.

## 🔗 **Cosmic Connections**

**Flows into**:
- → Virgo (grainprecision) - Vault requires precise configuration
- → Capricorn (grainstructure) - Storage needs structure, specs
- → Scorpio (graintransform) - Archives transform over time

**Receives from**:
- ← All repos - Everything eventually stores
- ← Pisces (grainflow) - Time governs retention policy
- ← Cancer (grainnurture) - Care determines what to keep

## 💫 **Usage Wisdom**

```bash
# Upload to cloud pasture (Taurus stores)
bb graindrive:upload --file harvest.tar.gz --folder backups

# Create clay archive (solidify the liquid)
bb grainclay:archive --source grainstore --dest archive/12025-10-24.tar.zst

# Run seasonal cleanup (prune with wisdom)
bb grainclay:cleanup --retention 90d --dry-run

# Sync vendor dependencies (tend the market)
bb vendor:sync
```

## 📚 **From Ye's Philosophy**

*"14 > 40"* - Four modules of essential storage. Drive, clay, cleanup, vendor. Keep what feeds. Release what rots. The vault is alive, not a tomb.

Storage without curation becomes clutter. Archives without cleanup become burden. Taurus knows: true wealth is useful abundance, not mindless accumulation.

## 🌊 **Cosmic Flow Inspirations**

- **Viktor Schauberger**: Natural storage patterns - water stores energy in vortices, earth stores memory in layers
- **Gerald Pollack**: Structured water holds information - archives structure chaos into knowledge
- **Matsuo Bashō**: "In Kyoto / hearing the cuckoo / I long for Kyoto" - What we store shapes longing, memory becomes presence
- **Ken Wheeler**: Dielectric storage - the vault as capacitor, holding potential
- **Nikola Tesla**: Scalar energy accumulation - true storage is field-based, not material

*"From farms comes nourishment. From original face comes recognition of need. From fixed earth springs patient abundance."*

**Taurus - ♉ - The Patient Builder** 🐂

🌾 *Store wisely. Prune kindly. Nourish eternally.* 🌾
