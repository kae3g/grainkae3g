# ðŸ”§ grain-musl - Clojure-musl Core Library

A high-performance Clojure library optimized for musl libc, providing better memory management, security, and performance than glibc-based systems.

## Vision

**"Every Great System Starts With musl libc"**

Create a Clojure library that:
- Leverages musl libc's superior memory management
- Provides better security than glibc
- Offers improved performance characteristics
- Works seamlessly with Alpine Linux
- Enables static linking and smaller binaries
