# Nock Specification: s6 Process Supervision

**Component**: s6 (skarnet's supervision suite)  
**Version**: 2.12.0.5 (reference implementation)  
**Size**: ~200KB  
**Purpose**: Process supervision and service management  
**Status**: Draft Specification v0.1

---

## Overview

s6 is a process supervision system that embodies the Unix philosophy: **do one thing well**. This Nock specification defines the mathematical essence of process supervision, independent of any particular implementation.

---

## Core Concepts (Nouns)

### Service State

A service is a noun representing process supervision state:

```nock
[service-name state pid timestamp logs]
```

Where:
- `service-name`: Atom (string as noun)
- `state`: Atom (0=down, 1=up, 2=finishing, 3=ready)
- `pid`: Atom (process ID, 0 if not running)
- `timestamp`: Atom (Unix time of last state change)
- `logs`: Cell of log entries

**Nock Representation**:
```nock
[/etc/s6/sv/dbus [1 1234 1728518400 [[timestamp "Starting dbus"] ~]]]
```

### Supervision Tree

A supervision tree is a noun representing the hierarchy of supervised services:

```nock
[svscan-root [service1 service2 service3 ...]]
```

**Example**:
```nock
[/run/service [[dbus 1 1234 ...] [networking 1 5678 ...] [wayland 0 0 ...]]]
```

---

## State Transitions (Nock Formulas)

### 1. Start Service

**Intent**: Transition service from `down` (0) to `up` (1).

**Nock Formula** (Rule 6 - if-then-else):
```nock
?[6 [5 [0 3]] [0 0] [4 [0 3]]]

Explanation:
- [0 3]: Get current state
- [5 [0 3] [1 0]]: Check if state == 0 (down)
- If true: [4 [0 3]] = inc state (0→1, down→up)
- If false: [0 0] = no-op (already up)
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn start-service [service]
  (if (= (:state service) 0)  ; If down
    (assoc service :state 1)   ; Set to up
    service))                   ; No change
```

**Proof Obligation**: Starting an already-running service is idempotent.

### 2. Stop Service

**Intent**: Transition service from `up` (1) to `finishing` (2), then to `down` (0).

**Nock Formula**:
```nock
?[6 [5 [0 3] [1 1]] [4 [0 3]] [0 0]]

Explanation:
- Check if state == 1 (up)
- If true: inc state (1→2, up→finishing)
- The "finish" script completes the transition to down (0)
```

**Two-Phase Stop**:
1. `up` (1) → `finishing` (2): SIGTERM sent, finish script runs
2. `finishing` (2) → `down` (0): Process exits, cleanup complete

**Proof Obligation**: Stopping follows crash-only semantics (clean teardown).

### 3. Restart Service

**Intent**: Atomic stop + start operation.

**Nock Formula** (Composition):
```nock
[7 [stop-formula] [start-formula]]

Explanation:
- Rule 7: Composition (f ∘ g)
- Apply stop, then apply start to result
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn restart-service [service]
  (-> service
      stop-service
      start-service))
```

**Proof Obligation**: Restart is equivalent to sequential stop-then-start.

### 4. Check Service Status

**Intent**: Read service state without modification.

**Nock Formula** (Rule 0 - tree addressing):
```nock
[0 3]  ; Get state field (axis 3 in service noun)
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn service-status [service]
  (:state service))
```

**Proof Obligation**: Status check is pure (no side effects).

---

## Crash-Only Semantics

### The Core Invariant

**Invariant**: A service in `down` state will be automatically restarted by the supervisor.

**Nock Formula** (Supervision Loop):
```nock
?[6 [5 [0 3] [1 0]]  ; If state == down
   [start-formula]    ; Start it
   [0 0]]             ; Else no-op
```

This implements the s6-svscan scan loop:
1. Check all services every ~5 seconds
2. If any service is down, start it
3. Repeat forever

**Proof Obligation**: The supervisor never leaves a service down indefinitely.

---

## Signal Handling

### Signal Types

Signals are atoms representing different control operations:

```nock
0 = SIGTERM  ; Graceful shutdown request
1 = SIGKILL  ; Immediate termination
2 = SIGHUP   ; Reload configuration
3 = SIGUSR1  ; User-defined signal 1
4 = SIGUSR2  ; User-defined signal 2
```

### Sending SIGTERM (Graceful Shutdown)

**Intent**: Request service to shut down cleanly.

**Nock Formula**:
```nock
[8 [send-signal 0] [wait-for-exit]]

Explanation:
- send-signal 0: Send SIGTERM to process
- wait-for-exit: Monitor process until it exits
- If timeout expires: escalate to SIGKILL
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn send-sigterm [service]
  (let [pid (:pid service)]
    (when (pos? pid)
      (.destroy (process-handle pid))  ; Send SIGTERM
      (assoc service :state :finishing))))
```

**Proof Obligation**: SIGTERM allows cleanup (finish script runs).

### Sending SIGKILL (Forced Termination)

**Intent**: Immediately terminate unresponsive service.

**Nock Formula**:
```nock
[8 [send-signal 1] [set-state 0]]

Explanation:
- send-signal 1: Send SIGKILL to process
- set-state 0: Immediately mark as down
- No cleanup possible (abrupt termination)
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn send-sigkill [service]
  (let [pid (:pid service)]
    (when (pos? pid)
      (.destroyForcibly (process-handle pid))  ; Send SIGKILL
      (assoc service :state :down :pid 0))))
```

**Proof Obligation**: SIGKILL never fails (kernel guarantees termination).

### Sending SIGHUP (Configuration Reload)

**Intent**: Request service to reload configuration without restart.

**Nock Formula**:
```nock
[8 [send-signal 2] [0 0]]

Explanation:
- send-signal 2: Send SIGHUP to process
- State unchanged (service remains up)
- Service handles reload internally
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn send-sighup [service]
  (let [pid (:pid service)]
    (when (pos? pid)
      (send-signal pid :HUP))
    service))  ; State unchanged
```

**Proof Obligation**: SIGHUP is idempotent (safe to send multiple times).

### Signal Escalation Policy

**Policy**: Graceful → Wait → Forced

```nock
[6 [timeout-expired?]
   [send-kill-formula]     ; If timeout: SIGKILL
   [wait-more-formula]]    ; Else: wait

Explanation:
1. Send SIGTERM
2. Wait up to N seconds (typically 5-10)
3. If process still running: send SIGKILL
4. If process exits: proceed to cleanup
```

**Timeout Configuration**:
```nock
[service-name deps state pid timestamp logs timeout-ms]

Where timeout-ms is typically:
- 5000 (5 seconds) for fast services
- 10000 (10 seconds) for database services
- 30000 (30 seconds) for graceful shutdown of complex services
```

**Proof Obligation**: Every service eventually terminates (SIGKILL is final).

---

## Logging Integration (s6-log)

### Log Entry

A log entry is a noun:

```nock
[timestamp severity message]
```

**Example**:
```nock
[1728518400 "info" "Service started successfully"]
```

### Log Appending

**Nock Formula** (Rule 4 - cons):
```nock
[4 [[1 [timestamp severity message]] [0 5]]]

Explanation:
- [0 5]: Get current logs
- [1 [...]]: New log entry
- [4 ...]: Cons new entry onto logs list
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn append-log [service timestamp severity message]
  (update service :logs conj [timestamp severity message]))
```

**Proof Obligation**: Logs are append-only (immutable history).

### Log Rotation

**Intent**: Prevent log files from growing unbounded.

**Rotation Triggers**:
```nock
[size-limit timestamp-limit]

Where:
- size-limit: Atom (max bytes before rotation, e.g. 1000000 = 1MB)
- timestamp-limit: Atom (max age in seconds, e.g. 86400 = 24 hours)
```

**Rotation Formula**:
```nock
[6 [or [size-exceeded?] [age-exceeded?]]
   [rotate-logs-formula]
   [continue-logging-formula]]

Explanation:
1. Check if size > size-limit OR age > timestamp-limit
2. If true: rotate logs (rename current → archive, create new)
3. If false: continue appending to current log
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn should-rotate? [log-file size-limit age-limit]
  (or (> (.length log-file) size-limit)
      (> (- (System/currentTimeMillis) (.lastModified log-file))
         (* age-limit 1000))))

(defn rotate-log [log-file]
  (let [timestamp (System/currentTimeMillis)
        archive-name (str (.getName log-file) "." timestamp)]
    (.renameTo log-file (io/file archive-name))
    (io/file (.getPath log-file))))  ; Create new empty log
```

**Proof Obligation**: Rotation is atomic (no log entries lost).

### Log Compression

**Intent**: Compress archived logs to save disk space.

**Compression Formula** (Applied after rotation):
```nock
[compress archived-log-name]

Explanation:
- Read archived log file
- Apply gzip compression
- Write to .gz file
- Delete uncompressed archive
```

**Compression Ratio**: Typically 10:1 for text logs (1MB → 100KB)

**Proof Obligation**: Compressed logs are byte-for-byte recoverable (lossless).

### Log Retention Policy

**Intent**: Delete old logs after retention period.

**Retention Formula**:
```nock
[filter-logs [list-archived-logs] [retention-predicate]]

Where retention-predicate:
  [6 [age < retention-days] [keep] [delete]]

Typical values:
- 7 days for debug logs
- 30 days for info logs
- 90 days for audit logs
- 365 days for compliance logs
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn cleanup-old-logs [log-dir retention-days]
  (let [cutoff-time (- (System/currentTimeMillis)
                       (* retention-days 86400 1000))]
    (doseq [log-file (file-seq (io/file log-dir))
            :when (and (.isFile log-file)
                       (< (.lastModified log-file) cutoff-time))]
      (.delete log-file))))
```

**Proof Obligation**: Logs within retention period are never deleted.

---

## Notification Protocol (Readiness)

### Service Readiness

**Intent**: Signal when a service is ready to accept requests.

**Readiness States**:
```nock
0 = starting  ; Service launched, not yet ready
1 = ready     ; Service accepting requests
2 = degraded  ; Service partially functional
3 = stopping  ; Service shutting down
```

**Readiness Notification Formula**:
```nock
[8 [check-readiness-condition] [update-state-if-ready]]

Explanation:
1. Service starts (state = 0, starting)
2. Service performs initialization
3. Service writes to readiness fifo: "READY=1\n"
4. Supervisor reads fifo, updates state to ready
5. Dependent services can now start
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn notify-ready [service]
  ;; Service writes to notification socket
  (spit (str (:service-dir service) "/notification-fifo")
        "READY=1\n")
  ;; Supervisor updates state
  (assoc service :state :ready))

(defn wait-for-ready [service timeout-ms]
  (let [start-time (System/currentTimeMillis)
        fifo-path (str (:service-dir service) "/notification-fifo")]
    (loop []
      (if-let [notification (read-line-from-fifo fifo-path)]
        (when (= notification "READY=1")
          (assoc service :state :ready))
        (when (< (- (System/currentTimeMillis) start-time) timeout-ms)
          (Thread/sleep 100)
          (recur))))))
```

**Proof Obligation**: Readiness notification is idempotent (safe to send multiple times).

### Readiness Checks

**Health Check Formula**:
```nock
[6 [http-get "/health"]
   [mark-ready]
   [mark-degraded]]

Explanation:
1. Periodically send HTTP GET to /health endpoint
2. If 200 OK: service is ready
3. If 503 Service Unavailable: service is degraded
4. If no response: service is starting or stopping
```

**Check Intervals**:
```nock
[check-interval retry-interval timeout]

Typical values:
- check-interval: 5000ms (5 seconds between checks)
- retry-interval: 1000ms (1 second between retries)
- timeout: 30000ms (30 seconds max wait for ready)
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn health-check [service]
  (try
    (let [response (http/get (str "http://localhost:"
                                  (:port service)
                                  "/health")
                             {:timeout 5000})]
      (case (:status response)
        200 (assoc service :state :ready)
        503 (assoc service :state :degraded)
        (assoc service :state :starting)))
    (catch Exception e
      (assoc service :state :starting))))
```

**Proof Obligation**: Health checks don't interfere with service operation (read-only).

### Readiness Dependencies

**Intent**: Start dependent services only when dependencies are ready.

**Dependency Readiness Formula**:
```nock
[8 [check-all-deps-ready] [start-if-all-ready]]

Explanation:
For each dependency:
  1. Check if state == ready (not just up)
  2. All deps ready → start this service
  3. Any dep not ready → wait

This extends the basic dependency ordering with readiness awareness.
```

**Example**:
```nock
[wayland [[dbus ready] [networking ready]] starting 0 ...]

Meaning:
- wayland depends on dbus AND networking
- Both must reach "ready" state (not just "up")
- Only then will wayland start
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn all-deps-ready? [service supervision-tree]
  (every? (fn [dep-name]
            (= :ready (:state (get supervision-tree dep-name))))
          (:deps service)))

(defn start-when-ready [service supervision-tree]
  (if (all-deps-ready? service supervision-tree)
    (start-service service)
    service))  ; Wait for dependencies
```

**Proof Obligation**: Services never start with unready dependencies (ordering preserved).

### Notification Fifo Protocol

**Fifo Path**:
```nock
[service-dir "/notification-fifo"]

Example: "/run/service/dbus/notification-fifo"
```

**Message Format** (newline-delimited text):
```
READY=1         ; Service ready to accept requests
RELOADING=1     ; Service reloading configuration
STOPPING=1      ; Service beginning shutdown
STATUS=text     ; Custom status message
ERRNO=num       ; Error number if startup failed
```

**Supervisor Reads Fifo**:
```nock
[8 [open-fifo] [read-lines] [parse-notifications] [update-state]]

Explanation:
1. Open fifo for reading (non-blocking)
2. Read all available lines
3. Parse each notification type
4. Update service state accordingly
```

**Clojure Equivalent**:
```clojure
(defn parse-notification [line]
  (let [[key value] (str/split line #"=" 2)]
    (case key
      "READY" {:event :ready}
      "RELOADING" {:event :reloading}
      "STOPPING" {:event :stopping}
      "STATUS" {:event :status :message value}
      "ERRNO" {:event :error :errno (Integer/parseInt value)}
      {:event :unknown})))

(defn process-notification [service notification]
  (case (:event notification)
    :ready (assoc service :state :ready)
    :reloading service  ; State unchanged, note reload in logs
    :stopping (assoc service :state :finishing)
    :error (assoc service :state :down :error (:errno notification))
    service))
```

**Proof Obligation**: Notification protocol is extensible (new message types don't break parser).

---

## Service Dependencies

### Dependency Graph

Services may depend on other services. This is represented as a cell of prerequisites:

```nock
[service [deps-list] state pid ...]
```

**Example**:
```nock
[wayland [[dbus] [networking]] 0 0 ...]
```

This means: "wayland depends on dbus and networking".

### Dependency Resolution (Topological Sort)

**Nock Formula** (Recursive):
```nock
; Check all dependencies are up before starting service
[8 [check-deps-formula] [start-if-ready-formula]]

Explanation:
- For each dep in deps-list:
  - Check if state == 1 (up)
- If all deps up: start service
- Else: wait
```

**Proof Obligation**: Dependency cycles are detected and rejected at configuration time.

---

## Atomic Operations

### The s6-svc Interface

s6-svc is the command-line tool for service control. Each command is an atomic operation:

| Command | Nock Formula | Effect |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| `s6-svc -u` | `start-formula` | Start (up) |
| `s6-svc -d` | `stop-formula` | Stop (down) |
| `s6-svc -r` | `restart-formula` | Restart |
| `s6-svc -o` | `once-formula` | Start once (no restart) |
| `s6-svstat` | `status-formula` | Check status |

**Proof Obligation**: All operations are atomic (no partial state).

---

## Equivalence Claims

### Claim 1: State Transitions Are Pure Functions

**Claim**: State transitions are deterministic functions `(state, input) → state`.

**Evidence**:
- Start: `state==0 → state==1`
- Stop: `state==1 → state==2 → state==0`
- Restart: `stop ∘ start`

**Verification Strategy**: Property-based testing with test.check.

### Claim 2: Supervision Loop Preserves Invariants

**Claim**: If a service should be up (not in "down once" mode), the supervisor will eventually start it.

**Evidence**:
- Scan loop checks every ~5 seconds
- If `state==0` and not "once" mode, trigger start
- Start is idempotent (safe to retry)

**Verification Strategy**: TLA+ temporal logic specification.

### Claim 3: Crash-Only Design

**Claim**: Services can be killed at any time without corruption.

**Evidence**:
- No global state (each service is independent)
- No shared memory between services
- Finish scripts handle cleanup
- Logs are append-only (no in-place updates)

**Verification Strategy**: Chaos engineering (kill -9 at random times).

---

## Jet Opportunities

### Hot Path: Service Status Check

**Current**: Reading service directory, parsing state file  
**Jet**: Cached in-memory status (update on state change)

**Optimization**: O(n) directory scan → O(1) hash table lookup

### Hot Path: Log Rotation

**Current**: s6-log rotates logs based on size/time  
**Jet**: Memory-mapped circular buffer

**Optimization**: Reduces disk I/O, faster appends

---

## Formal Verification (Future Work)

### Coq Proof Outline

```coq
(* State type *)
Inductive ServiceState : Type :=
  | Down : ServiceState
  | Up : ServiceState
  | Finishing : ServiceState
  | Ready : ServiceState.

(* State transition *)
Definition start_service (s : ServiceState) : ServiceState :=
  match s with
  | Down => Up
  | _ => s
  end.

(* Idempotence proof *)
Theorem start_idempotent : forall s,
  s <> Down -> start_service s = s.
Proof.
  intros. destruct s; auto.
  contradiction.
Qed.
```

## Summary

s6 process supervision, at its core, is:
1. **State management**: `down → up → finishing → down`
2. **Automatic restart**: Crashed services are brought back up
3. **Atomic operations**: Commands are indivisible
4. **Crash-only design**: No corruption on unexpected termination

**All of this can be expressed in Nock's 12 rules.**

The s6 specification is eternal. Implementations may vary (C, Rust, Clojure), but the mathematical essence—captured here in Nock—remains constant.

🌱 **"The seed is eternal. The plant is temporary."** 🌱
