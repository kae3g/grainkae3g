The **ceremony** or **launch ceremony** was the event that transferred custody of [Azimuth](../Azimuth) identities from a centralized ledger to the Ethereum blockchain. Before the ceremony, the Tlon Corporation kept track of ownership in a spreadsheet. The ceremony created Ethereum tokens for those entries and transferred them to the appropriate [HD Wallets](../hdwallet).
