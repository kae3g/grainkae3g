This guide covers best practices for preparing your environment to develop
within the Urbit ecosystem.

## Creating a development ship 

To do work with Hoon, we recommended using a "fake" ship -- one that's not
connected to the network.

Because such a ship has no presence on the network, you don't need an Azimuth
identity. You just need to have [installed the Urbit binary](/getting-started).

To create a fake ship named `~zod`, run the command below. You can replace `zod`
with any valid Urbit ship-name.

```
./urbit -F zod
```

This should take a couple of minutes, during which you should see a block of boot
messages, starting with the Urbit version number. 


## Hoon support in text editors
