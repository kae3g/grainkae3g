# Personal Reminders

## Our Origin Is Not Here

This phrase, "our origin is not here," resonates deeply with the journey of building a personal sovereignty stack. It speaks to a sense of displacement from conventional systems and a yearning for a more authentic, self-determined digital existence.

It implies:
- **A rejection of centralized control**: Our digital "origin" is not in the hands of corporations or monolithic platforms.
- **A search for true roots**: We are seeking a foundation that aligns with our values, perhaps in decentralized networks, open-source principles, or self-hosted infrastructure.
- **A philosophical stance**: Our true potential, our "origin," lies beyond the current limitations and compromises of the mainstream tech landscape.

This note serves as a reminder of the core motivation behind this project: to forge a new path, to build a system where our digital selves are truly our own, and where our "origin" is defined by our own choices and creations, not by external forces.
