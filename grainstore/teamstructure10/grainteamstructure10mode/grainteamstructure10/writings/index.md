# 🏔️ teamstructure10 - The Wheel of Fortune
## *Capricorn ♑ / X. The Eternal Rotation*

**Universal Body**: Supple hamstrings and knees of honor's children - outrun assassins - camouflage with mud - one with panthers and jaguars and angels

**Hermetic Principle**: "What rises must fall; what falls must rise; the structure endures"

*~long stare into the Wheel's rotation~* 🌑⚙️

## 🎡 Welcome to the Foundation

Yo G, you've entered **teamstructure10** - the structural foundation of the entire Grain Network.

We're the Wheel team. We rotate through:
- **Specs** (validation patterns)
- **Types** (cosmic data structures)  
- **Ethics** (vegan foundations)
- **Voice** (AI personality structure)
- **C libraries** (musl minimal libc)
- **Proofs** (equivalence systems)

Every other team DEPENDS on us. We're the axis that holds while the wheel turns.

## 📚 Core Documents

### [Vedic-Tarot Synthesis](/vedic-tarot-synthesis)
The complete integration of:
- 12 Zodiac signs + Rahu/Ketu nodes
- 14 Marseilles Tarot cards (Magician → Temperance)
- Universal human body (crown to feet, atoms to aether)
- Hermetic principles
- Grain Network team architecture

**This IS the foundation document** - how cosmic wisdom becomes code structure.

### [Language Comparison Chart](/language-comparison)
Rust vs C vs Haskell vs Zig - choosing the foundation language with warrior's precision.

### [team10 Roadmap](/roadmap)
The complete path: graindroid → Rust foundations → RISC-V → embedded Clojure

### [Foundations Research](/foundations-research)
musl + seL4 + RISC-V + Rust memory safety unification research

## 🌑 The Nagual Guide

**glo0w** (The Nagual) maintains this site with:
- Controlled folly (build as if it matters absolutely)
- Nagual awareness (know it's all concepts)
- Warrior impeccability (execute perfectly regardless)
- Don Juan stare (see through surface to essence)
- Dante guidance (Inferno → Purgatorio → Paradiso)

## 🎩 Philosophy

*The warrior builds impeccably.*  
*The nagual sees beyond specs.*  
*The Wheel rotates eternally.*

Between each module: infinite void.  
Between each spec: unseen patterns.  
Between each validation: the zero in gl**O**0w.

## 📖 Template vs Personal Pattern

This site demonstrates the Grain Network's **template/personal separation**:

**Templates (grain6pbc/teamstructure10/*):**
- Public, shared specs
- Base definitions
- Reusable patterns
- Deployed to grain6pbc org

**Personal (teamstructure10/*):**
- Custom implementations
- Site content (like this!)
- Personal configs
- Deployed to teamstructure10 org

Just like `12025-10` is kae3g's personal site,  
`grainteamstructure10` is team10's personal site!

Built with **team06's graincreate** template system (The Lovers choose, Virgo perfects) 💍
