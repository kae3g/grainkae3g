What draws us to these glowing rectangles and makes us want to understand their secrets?</em></p><h3>Real Voices</h3><p><strong>Here's what people said when I asked</strong>:</p><blockquote><p> <em>\"Probably music editing software?\"</em> </p></blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>\"Interesting question. They're useful to create music as well as explore other experiences through games.\"</em> </p></blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>\"I can do almost anything with them!\"</em> </p></blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>\"Hmmmm good question lol. To be totally honest I'm not a big fan of computers, the digital realm always feels a bit strange to me. I guess… the ability to find exotic mind and body expanding ideas/culture/history and art that can be fed into real life transformation and inspiration. Being able to talk to people from other countries that otherwise you'd never come into contact with. Recently I met this girl online from Iran who immediately had a psychic connection to me it was so wild.. one off strange events like that make it all feel worthwhile.\"</em> </p></blockquote><blockquote><p> <em>\"Um I use chat gpt a lot.\"</em> </p></blockquote><p><strong>Notice the range</strong>: From skepticism to creative tools to connection to AI. Each answer reveals a different aspect of why these machines matter.</p><h2>The Manifesto of Digital Love</h2><blockquote><p> <strong>\"We are building a new computational valley where systems grow like rhizomes, not hierarchies. But first, let us remember why we fell in love with computers in the first place.\"</strong> </p></blockquote><p>In a world where computers have become so ubiquitous that we sometimes forget to marvel at them, we asked people from all walks of life: <strong>\"What is your favorite thing about computers?\"</strong></p><p>Their answers remind us that behind every technical concept, every system design, every line of code, there is something fundamentally human: wonder, creativity, connection, and joy.</p><h2>The Voices of Digital Love</h2><p><em>Here are their answers, preserved exactly as they were shared:</em></p><h3>The Poetic Responses</h3><p><strong>\"The fact they go to sleep like us humans\"</strong> <em>— A beautiful observation about the rhythm of digital life</em></p><p><strong>\"Uhhh gaming I guess lol\"</strong> <em>— The honest joy of play and exploration (we've all been there!)</em></p><p><strong>\"I have no idea, I low-key have tech anxiety\"</strong> <em>— The vulnerable truth about our complex relationship with technology (and that's totally valid!)</em></p><p><strong>\"Hmmmmmm, The capacity they have for what seems infinite to me\"</strong> <em>— Awe at the vastness of computational possibility</em></p><p><strong>\"Idk. That's a very broad question\"</strong> <em>— The honest acknowledgment that computers mean so many different things</em></p><p><strong>\"The fact that they are good at helping people. For a long while now I've been convinced software is one of the most powerful things on this planet. AI is just an extension of that, but it's another powerful extension\"</strong> <em>— Recognition of computers as tools for human flourishing</em></p><p><strong>\"Shopping 🤣🤣🤣 , But I think that my favorite thing it how accessible knowledge is\"</strong> <em>— The delightful contradiction: practical convenience meets profound access to human knowledge</em></p><p><strong>\"That I can look information up quickly that it would take me in the past, walking to a library, looking in a catalogue and finding a book number. Walking to a shelf and looking all around for a particular book to find information. It is information at your fingertips. An absolute fucking miracle. And a game changer. I got a three-point in Berkeley with no computer. That's fucking smart.\"</strong> <em>— A beautiful meditation on how far we've come, and what we've gained</em></p><p><strong>\"Hmmmm I guess UI\"</strong> <em>— The appreciation for design, the interface between human and machine</em></p><p><strong>\"I'm not sure I like that I can type  on them I also like having them to read it research\"</strong> <em>— The dual love of creation and discovery, typing and reading, making and learning</em></p><p><strong>\"I learned early on that that's something that can keep up with my ADHD 😂\"</strong> <em>— The perfect match between a fast mind and a fast machine</em></p><p><strong>\"Communication with people not in my country\"</strong> <em>— Breaking through borders, connecting across continents</em></p><p><strong>\"Trading, My gf loves gaming , She was talking about gaming with me , Last night\"</strong> <em>— The way computers bring us together—through markets, through games, through shared passions</em></p><h3>The Growing Collection</h3><p><em>We're still gathering responses from friends, family, colleagues, and strangers around the world. Each answer will be added here as they arrive, creating a living document of human-computer love.</em></p><p><em>If you're reading this and want to contribute, reach out—we'd love to add your voice to this celebration.</em></p><h2>Why This Matters</h2><p>These answers reveal something profound about our relationship with technology:</p><h3>The Universal Connection</h3><p>From the most casual user to the deepest system programmer, we all find something magical in computers. Whether it's the way they \"sleep\" or the worlds they create for us to explore, there's a fundamental human connection that transcends technical complexity.</p><h3>The Bridge Between Worlds</h3><p>Computers are not just tools—they're extensions of our creativity, our curiosity, our desire to build and explore. They're the bridge between our analog lives and the infinite possibilities of digital space.</p><h3>The Invitation to Wonder</h3><p>Every person who loves computers, regardless of their technical background, is invited into the deeper mysteries. The gaming enthusiast might one day wonder how those games are made. The person who loves how computers sleep might become curious about power management and system design.</p><h2>The Valley Awaits</h2><p><em>As we stand at the threshold of our computational valley, we remember that every journey begins with love—love for the possibilities, love for the mysteries, love for the simple joy of interaction with these remarkable machines.</em></p><h3>Who This Valley Is For</h3><p>This repository and the journey that follows is for:</p><p><strong>🎮 The Gamers</strong> — Who love the worlds computers create and want to understand how they're built</p><p><strong>🎨 The Creatives</strong> — Who use computers as their canvas and want to master their tools</p><p><strong>🔧 The Builders</strong> — Who see computers as puzzles to be solved and systems to be optimized</p><p><strong>🌱 The Curious</strong> — Who wonder how things work and want to understand the deeper magic</p><p><strong>🏢 The Professionals</strong> — Who rely on computers daily and want to build better, more reliable systems</p><p><strong>👶 The Young</strong> — Who are growing up in a digital world and want to understand their environment</p><p><strong>👴 The Wise</strong> — Who remember when computers were new and want to see where they're going</p><p><strong>🌍 The Global</strong> — From every culture, every language, every background, united by digital wonder</p><h3>The Journey Begins</h3><p><em>\"The fact they go to sleep like us humans\"</em> — This simple observation reveals the deep truth that computers are not alien machines, but extensions of our own rhythms and patterns.</p><p><em>\"Uhhh gaming I guess lol\"</em> — This honest response captures the pure joy of interaction, the playfulness that lies at the heart of all great computing.</p><p>From these simple loves, we can build understanding. From understanding, we can build mastery. From mastery, we can build the future.</p><h2>The Call to Adventure</h2><p><em>The valley stretches before us, filled with ancient wisdom and modern possibilities. The wise elders await, ready to share their knowledge. The complexity dragons lurk in the shadows, waiting to be understood and tamed.</em></p><p><strong>Your journey begins with love—love for computers, love for learning, love for the endless possibilities of digital creation.</strong><h2></h2></p><p><strong>Next Writing:</strong> <a href='9949-intro-clojure-nix-ecosystem'>9949: The Wise Elders Meet</a> — Introduction to Clojure & Nix Ecosystems<br /> <strong>Previous Writing:</strong> <em>(This is 9948, the beginning of our celebration of digital love)</em><h2></h2></p><p><em>\"The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.\"</em><br /> — Laozi, Tao Te Ching, Chapter 64</p><p><em>But first, we must remember why we want to take that step.</em><h2></h2></p><p><a href='/12025-10/'>View All Essays</a></p><h2></h2><p><div style=\"text-align: center; opacity: 0.6; font-size: 0.85em; margin-top: 3em; padding-top: 1em; border-top: 1px solid rgba(139, 116, 94, 0.2);\"></p><p><strong>Copyright © 2025 <a href='https://codeberg.org/kae3g/12025-10/'>kae3g</a></strong> | Dual-licensed under <a href='https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0'>Apache-2.0</a> / <a href='https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT'>MIT</a><br /> Competitive technology in service of clarity and beauty</p><p></div></p><p><em><a href='/12025-10/hidden-docs-index.html'>View Hidden Docs Index</a></em> | <em><a href='/12025-10/'>Return to Main Index</a></em></p>",
