You owe taxes you'll never understand, fought in wars you didn't declare, and live under laws you never voted for. But the real extraction happens closer to home.<h2></h2></p><h3>The Regional Kings (State Governments)</h3><p><strong>Medieval Parallel:</strong> Kings, Dukes<br /> <strong>Function:</strong> Control large territories, set laws, collect tribute, theoretically constrained by Divine Emperor but often autonomous in practice.</p><p><strong>Power:</strong></p><ul><li>Control land use (zoning, environmental regulations)</li><li>Extract tribute (state taxes, fees, licenses)</li><li>Grant privileges to local lords (corporate tax breaks, development permits)</li><li>Monopolize violence (state police, National Guard)</li></ul><p><strong>California as Example:</strong></p><ul><li>Richest state in the union ($3.9 trillion GDP, 5th largest economy globally if independent)</li><li>Extreme inequality (Silicon Valley billionaires, agricultural millionaires, and homeless encampments)</li><li>Feudal land consolidation (majority of agricultural land held by <5% of operators)</li><li>Water as the new currency (he who controls water controls California)</li></ul><p><strong>Relationship to Peasants:</strong> You need their permission to work (occupational licenses), live (housing regulations), or move (vehicle registration, professional licensing across state lines). They extract wealth through property taxes, income taxes, sales taxes, and endless fees.<h2></h2></p><h3>The Armored Knights (Credit Unions, Regional Banks, Investment Funds)</h3><p><strong>Medieval Parallel:</strong> Knights Templar, Feudal Lords with Armies<br /> <strong>Function:</strong> <strong>This is where the real extraction happens.</strong> Control capital, wage economic warfare, extract tribute through interest, shape local economies to their benefit.</p><p><strong>THE CREDIT UNION KNIGHT MODEL:</strong></p><p>Credit unions market themselves as \"community-focused,\" \"member-owned,\" \"not-for-profit.\" This is the equivalent of feudal lords claiming to protect peasants out of noblesse oblige. In reality:</p><p><strong>Structure:</strong></p><ul><li>Member-owned (in theory) but board-controlled by local elites</li><li>Tax-exempt status (unlike banks) but operating identically</li><li>\"Non-profit\" but executives making $200k-$500k+ salaries</li><li>Local presence creates appearance of community investment</li></ul><p><strong>Economic Warfare Tactics:</strong></p><p><strong>1. The Civic Investment Gambit (Sebastopol / Truckee Model)</strong></p><p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p><ul><li>Credit union partners with municipality to \"invest\" in civic district development</li><li>Municipality grants development permits, tax incentives, infrastructure support</li><li>Credit union finances construction of \"community space\" (The Barlow in Sebastopol, Truckee Railyard, Village at Squaw Valley)</li><li>Rents are set at rates only chain stores and high-end businesses can afford</li><li>Local small businesses priced out</li><li>Property values skyrocket</li><li>Original residents (peasants) priced out through rent increases</li><li>Credit union holds debt on properties, collects interest for 30 years</li><li>Municipality increases property tax base, extracts more from residents</li></ul><p><strong>Who Benefits:</strong></p><ul><li>Credit union (interest income, real estate appreciation)</li><li>Municipality (tax revenue, \"economic development\" talking points)</li><li>Chain retailers (stable locations in high-income areas)</li><li>Property developers (construction contracts)</li><li>Wealthy newcomers (amenity-rich neighborhoods)</li></ul><p><strong>Who Pays:</strong></p><ul><li>Workers (priced out of housing)</li><li>Farmers (land values too high to farm profitably, taxed based on \"highest and best use\")</li><li>Small business owners (can't afford rent in \"revitalized\" areas)</li><li>Long-time residents (community destroyed, forced to commute or leave)</li></ul><p><strong>The Barlow, Sebastopol — Case Study:</strong></p><ul><li>Former apple processing plant converted to \"community market\"</li><li>Funded by Redwood Credit Union, city of Sebastopol, and private investors</li><li>Now: boutique restaurants, high-end retail, craft breweries, yoga studios</li><li>Monthly rent: $3,000-$8,000 for small retail spaces</li><li>Result: Sebastopol transformed from agricultural town to wine-country tourist destination</li><li>Median home price: $950,000 (2024)</li><li>Agricultural workers: live in Rohnert Park or Santa Rosa, commute in</li><li>Original community: dispersed, can't afford to live in town they built</li></ul><p><strong>Truckee, California — Case Study:</strong></p><ul><li>Historical railroad/logging town, working-class ski resort workers</li><li>Truckee Railyard redevelopment: Tahoe Mountain Club investment + Truckee Tahoe Airport District + private equity</li><li>Squaw Valley (now Palisades Tahoe) village development: KSL Capital Partners + Alterra Mountain Company</li><li>Worker housing crisis: Median home $1.2 million, average rent $3,000/month for 1BR</li><li>Solution offered: \"Workforce housing\" (company-owned apartments at $2,000/month for $18/hr workers)</li><li>Reality: Modern company town — work for the resort, live in resort-owned housing, shop at resort-owned stores, drink at resort-owned bars</li><li>If you quit or get fired: eviction (housing tied to employment)</li><li>This is feudalism with extra steps</li></ul><p><strong>2. The Agricultural Land Grab</strong></p><p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p><ul><li>Small farmer faces crisis (drought, crop failure, medical emergency, equipment breakdown)</li><li>Credit union offers loan (appearing as savior)</li><li>Interest rates: 6-12% (credit cards 18-28% if they go that route)</li><li>Farmer cannot repay (margins too thin, one bad season)</li><li>Credit union offers \"partnership\": sell land, lease it back, continue farming</li><li>Farmer becomes sharecropper on their own ancestral land</li><li>Credit union leases land to developer or large agricultural corporation</li><li>Farmer evicted, land converted to vineyard/cannabis farm/luxury subdivision</li></ul><p><strong>The Numbers:</strong></p><ul><li>California: 70% of farmland is rented/leased (farmer doesn't own land they work)</li><li>Average farmer age: 60 years old (no succession plan, children don't want the debt)</li><li>Average farm profit margin: 3-5% (one bad year = bankruptcy)</li><li>Agricultural land value appreciation: 8-12% annually (farming it is less profitable than selling it)</li><li>Result: Land consolidation — 3% of farms produce 50% of agricultural output</li></ul><p><strong>Who This Serves:</strong></p><ul><li>Credit unions / investment funds (land appreciates, interest collected, then resale profit)</li><li>Large agricultural corporations (consolidation = efficiency = profit)</li><li>Wealthy landowners (investment property, tax write-offs)</li></ul><p><strong>Who This Destroys:</strong></p><ul><li>Family farmers (generational land lost)</li><li>Farmworkers (large operations automate or use exploitative labor)</li><li>Food security (monoculture replaces diversity)</li><li>Rural communities (social fabric ripped apart)<h2></h2></li></ul><h3>The Monasteries (Universities, Medical Systems, Non-Profits)</h3><p><strong>Medieval Parallel:</strong> Monasteries, Churches<br /> <strong>Function:</strong> Control knowledge, healthcare, and salvation narratives. Extract wealth through \"education\" and \"healing.\" Accumulate land and capital under guise of serving the poor.</p><p><strong>THE UNIVERSITY MONASTERY:</strong></p><p>Medieval monasteries owned vast lands, charged for education (if you could afford it), and extracted labor from peasants as \"tithes.\" Modern universities do exactly the same.</p><p><strong>Structure:</strong></p><ul><li>Tax-exempt (like churches)</li><li>Own billions in real estate and endowments</li><li>Charge peasants $50,000-$80,000/year for \"salvation\" (degree)</li><li>Bind peasants through debt they cannot discharge (student loans non-dischargeable in bankruptcy since 1976)</li><li>Provide luxury amenities (gyms, lazy rivers, climbing walls) while adjunct professors live on food stamps</li></ul><p><strong>The Student Debt Knight's Lance:</strong></p><p>Student debt is the most perfect feudal control mechanism ever invented:</p><p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p><ol><li>Tell children from age 5: \"You must go to college or you'll be a failure\"</li><li>Charge $200,000-$300,000 for 4-year degree (room, board, tuition)</li><li>Loan is guaranteed by federal government (no risk to lender)</li><li>Interest rates: 5-8% (compounding)</li><li>Cannot discharge in bankruptcy (only debt with this \"feature\")</li><li>Repayment starts 6 months after graduation</li><li>Average monthly payment: $200-$500 for 20-30 years</li><li>Total paid over life of loan: $300,000-$500,000 (on $200,000 borrowed)</li><li>Miss payments: wage garnishment, tax refund seizure, credit score destruction</li></ol><p><strong>Result:</strong></p><ul><li>45 million Americans owe $1.7 trillion in student debt</li><li>Average debt: $38,000 (public university), $54,000 (private)</li><li>Delays: marriage, children, home ownership, entrepreneurship, retirement savings</li><li><strong>You are bound to a corporate job (to make payments) exactly like a feudal peasant bound to land</strong></li></ul><p><strong>The Monastic Landholdings:</strong></p><p>Universities own vast real estate:</p><ul><li>Harvard endowment: $53 billion</li><li>Stanford endowment: $36 billion</li><li>UC system landholdings: 150,000+ acres</li><li>They pay no property taxes (exempt)</li><li>They develop land for profit (UC Berkeley luxury housing)</li><li>They extract rent from students (mandatory on-campus housing, meal plans)</li></ul><p><strong>This is a monastery owning half the village.</strong><h2></h2></p><p><strong>THE HEALTHCARE MONASTERY:</strong></p><p>If universities control salvation through education, hospitals control salvation through healing. And like medieval monasteries that charged for prayers and relics, hospitals charge for healing—except the prices are literally deadly.</p><p><strong>Structure:</strong></p><ul><li>\"Non-profit\" hospitals (70% of US hospitals) pay zero taxes</li><li>But: CEOs make $3-10 million/year</li><li>Hospital \"systems\" own vast real estate (Kaiser, Sutter, etc.)</li><li>Extract wealth through: insurance premiums, deductibles, out-of-network fees, surprise billing</li><li>Debt collection: hospitals sue patients, garnish wages, seize homes</li></ul><p><strong>The Healthcare Extraction Cycle:</strong></p><ol><li>Get sick or injured (inevitable)</li><li>Go to hospital (no choice in emergency)</li><li>Receive bill: $50,000 for appendectomy, $150,000 for childbirth complications, $500,000+ for cancer treatment</li><li>Insurance pays portion (if you have insurance)</li><li>You owe: $5,000-$50,000+ (deductibles, co-pays, out-of-network, \"not covered\")</li><li>Cannot pay (you're a peasant)</li><li>Payment plan offered: $500/month for 10 years (= $60,000 paid on $30,000 debt due to interest/fees)</li><li>Miss payments: collections, credit destruction, lawsuit, wage garnishment</li><li>Result: medical debt is #1 cause of bankruptcy in US</li></ol><p><strong>The Numbers:</strong></p><ul><li>100 million Americans have medical debt</li><li>41% of Americans have medical debt in collections</li><li>Average medical debt: $5,000 (but 20% owe $25,000+)</li><li>Medical bankruptcy: 66% of all bankruptcies (pre-ACA and still post-ACA)</li></ul><p><strong>The Feudal Parallel:</strong></p><p>Medieval peasant gets sick → goes to monastery → monks \"heal\" them (maybe) → peasant owes monastery labor/crops for life → cannot leave until debt paid → debt passes to children</p><p>Modern peasant gets sick → goes to hospital → doctors heal them (usually) → peasant owes hospital money for life → cannot escape (wages garnished) → debt affects children (can't help with college, inheritance reduced)</p><p><strong>This is the same structure with better medicine and worse accounting.</strong><h2></h2></p><h3>The Peasants (Workers, Farmers, Service Industry)</h3><p><strong>Medieval Parallel:</strong> Serfs, Tenant Farmers, Villains<br /> <strong>Function:</strong> Produce all actual value. Own nothing or almost nothing. Bound by debt, not by law, but the effect is the same.</p><p><strong>THE NEW PEASANTRY DEMOGRAPHICS:</strong></p><p><strong>The Agricultural Peasant (Farm Workers):</strong></p><ul><li>Pick crops for $15-$20/hour (no benefits)</li><li>Live in employer-provided housing (trailers, barracks) or crowded apartments</li><li>Cannot afford to live near where they work</li><li>No healthcare (except emergency)</li><li>No retirement savings</li><li>One injury = destitution</li><li>Immigration status weaponized to prevent organizing</li></ul><p><strong>The Service Peasant (Restaurant, Retail, Hospitality Workers):</strong></p><ul><li>Work 2-3 jobs to afford rent</li><li>$18-$25/hour in high-cost areas (Sebastopol, Truckee, wine country, ski resorts)</li><li>Rent for 1BR: $1,800-$3,000/month</li><li>After rent: $500-$1,000 remaining for food, transport, healthcare, debt, savings (impossible)</li><li>No healthcare (or high-deductible plans that cost $400/month and cover nothing until $6,000 out-of-pocket)</li><li>One car breakdown = financial crisis</li><li>One medical emergency = bankruptcy</li></ul><p><strong>The Knowledge Peasant (Educated but Indebted):</strong></p><ul><li>Has degree (cost: $100,000-$300,000 in debt)</li><li>Works corporate job ($50,000-$80,000 salary)</li><li>Student loan payment: $500-$1,000/month</li><li>Rent: $1,500-$2,500/month (roommates into 30s)</li><li>Healthcare: $300/month premium + $3,000 deductible</li><li>After expenses: $200-$500/month remaining (no savings, no home ownership, no children)</li><li>Cannot quit job (debt payments)</li><li>Cannot move (job specific to location/industry)</li><li>Cannot protest (blacklist risk)</li><li><strong>This is a white-collar serf</strong></li></ul><p><strong>The Gig Peasant (Uber, DoorDash, Instacart, TaskRabbit):</strong></p><ul><li>\"Independent contractor\" (no benefits, no protections)</li><li>$15-$25/hour before expenses</li><li>After vehicle costs (gas, maintenance, insurance): $10-$15/hour</li><li>No healthcare, no workers comp, no unemployment insurance</li><li>Algorithm determines work (like feudal lord assigning daily tasks)</li><li>Can be \"deactivated\" (fired) without recourse</li><li>Must maintain 4.7+ star rating (one bad customer = loss of livelihood)</li><li><strong>This is feudalism with an app</strong><h2></h2></li></ul><p><strong>THE BINDING MECHANISMS (How Peasants Are Kept in Place):</strong></p><p>Medieval peasants were bound by law (couldn't leave manor without permission).<br /> Modern peasants are bound by debt and necessity:</p><p><strong>Debt Chains:</strong></p><ul><li>Student loans: $200-$500/month (20-30 years)</li><li>Medical debt: $100-$500/month (payment plans)</li><li>Car loan: $300-$600/month (required for work in car-dependent areas)</li><li>Credit card debt: $200-$400/month (accumulated from emergencies)</li><li>Rent: $1,500-$3,000/month (cannot save for down payment)</li></ul><p><strong>Total Debt Service:</strong> $2,300-$5,000/month before food, utilities, phone, internet, childcare</p><p><strong>To afford this, you need:</strong></p><ul><li>Stable employment (cannot quit, cannot protest, cannot risk)</li><li>Often multiple jobs (no time for organizing, education, rest)</li><li>No safety net (one crisis = spiral)</li></ul><p><strong>This is bonded labor with extra steps.</strong><h2></h2></p><p><strong>THE HEALTH CRISIS AS CONTROL MECHANISM:</strong></p><p>The healthcare system isn't broken—<strong>it's working exactly as designed to keep peasants bound.</strong></p><p><strong>Why:</strong></p><ul><li>Healthcare tied to employment (you cannot quit or lose coverage)</li><li>Costs so high that one illness = debt spiral</li><li>Chronic conditions keep you productive but dependent (you can work, but you need insulin/inhalers/meds that cost $500/month)</li><li>Mental health untreated (keeps people from organizing or recognizing the system)</li></ul><p><strong>Example: The Diabetic Agricultural Peasant</strong></p><ul><li>Farmworker in California</li><li>Develops Type 2 diabetes (common due to stress, food insecurity, lack of healthcare)</li><li>Needs insulin, test strips, doctor visits</li><li>Cost without insurance: $500-$800/month</li><li>Employer insurance (if offered): $400/month premium + $5,000 deductible + 20% co-pay</li><li>Effective cost: $400/month premium + ~$400/month out-of-pocket until deductible met</li><li>Cannot quit job (would lose insurance and die within weeks/months without insulin)</li><li>Cannot organize (boss threatens: \"You're easily replaced, and your insurance ends the day you're fired\")</li><li>Cannot move to better job (new insurance might not cover pre-existing condition for 6-12 months)</li></ul><p><strong>This is a chain made of insulin vials instead of iron.</strong><h2></h2></p><h2>Part II: The City-State Model (Where Extraction Is Most Visible)</h2><h3>The Agricultural City-State (Sebastopol, Napa, Sonoma, Healdsburg)</h3><p><strong>Medieval Parallel:</strong> Italian city-states (Florence, Siena, Venice)<br /> <strong>Structure:</strong> Small, wealthy urban center surrounded by agricultural hinterlands that feed it but don't benefit from it.</p><p><strong>SEBASTOPOL, CALIFORNIA — CASE

homes</li><li>Land values skyrocket (proximity to San Francisco, wine tourism)</li><li>Property taxes based on land value, not current use</li><li>Apple farmers cannot afford to farm (taxes exceed profit)</li><li>Solution: Sell to developers or convert to vineyard (higher margin)</li></ul><p><strong>Phase 2: Civic Redevelopment (2010-2020)</strong></p><ul><li>The Barlow project (2013): 12-acre

appreciation)</li><li>Property developers (construction contracts)</li><li>Wealthy newcomers (amenities, prestige address)</li><li>Municipality (tax revenue)</li></ul><p><strong>Who Loses:</strong></p><ul><li>Original farmers (land sold, can't afford to stay)</li><li>Working-class residents (priced out)</li><li>Small businesses (can't compete with high-end

Legitimacy Through Branding</strong></p><p>Credit unions market themselves as:</p><ul><li>\"Community-focused\"</li><li>\"Member-owned\"</li><li>\"Not-for-profit\"</li><li>\"Better than banks\"</li></ul><p>This is like feudal lords claiming to protect peasants out of nobility and honor, not extraction and control. The branding obscures the reality.</p><p><strong>2. Tax Exemption (Like Medieval Church Lands)</strong></p><ul><li>Credit unions pay NO federal income tax</li><li>Exemption justified as \"serving members, not profit\"</li><li>Reality: Executives make $200,000-$500,000+ salaries, operate identically to banks</li><li>Tax exemption = subsidy from taxpayers (who are often the peasants they extract from)</li></ul><p><strong>3. Local Presence Creates Captive Market</strong></p><ul><li>Small towns/regions have 1-2 dominant credit unions</li><li>Everyone banks there (community pressure, limited alternatives)</li><li>Credit union holds: mortgages, car loans, business loans, credit cards</li><li><strong>If you're late on one loan, they can cross-collateralize (seize your car to cover mortgage, etc.)</strong></li><li>This is power</li></ul><p><strong>4. Economic Warfare Capability</strong></p><p>Credit unions can:</p><ul><li>Partner with municipalities to finance development</li><li>Undercut competing banks (tax advantage)</li><li>Extract long-term interest income (30-year mortgages = 30 years of profit)</li><li>Foreclose and seize assets (agricultural land, homes, businesses)</li><li>Shape local economy (choose which businesses/projects to finance)</li></ul><p><strong>Example: Redwood Credit Union (Sonoma County)</strong></p><ul><li>Assets: $8+ billion</li><li>Members: 450,000+</li><li>CEO salary: $500,000+ (2023)</li><li>Major

(makes politicians look good)</li><li>Long-term financing (patient capital)</li></ul><p><strong>Municipality Provides:</strong></p><ul><li>Development permits (worth millions in entitled land value)</li><li>Tax incentives (property tax reductions, fee waivers)</li><li>Infrastructure (roads, water, sewer paid by taxpayers)</li><li>Eminent domain (if needed to assemble land parcels)</li><li>Legitimacy (government-backed development = less risk)</li></ul><p><strong>Result:</strong></p><ul><li>Credit union profits through interest income and asset appreciation</li><li>Municipality profits through increased tax base</li><li>Developers profit through construction contracts</li><li>Wealthy newcomers profit through amenities and property appreciation</li></ul><p><strong>Peasants:</strong></p><ul><li>Pay taxes that fund infrastructure benefiting the wealthy</li><li>Priced out by resulting gentrification</li><li>Lose community and

Mechanisms</h2><h3>The Healthcare Crisis (The Monastery's Extraction)</h3><p><strong>Design, Not Accident:</strong></p><p>The US healthcare system is the most expensive in the world ($4.3 trillion annually, 17% of GDP) and produces middling outcomes (life expectancy, infant mortality worse than peer nations). This isn't failure—<strong>it's the system working as designed to extract maximum wealth and control labor.</strong></p><p><strong>The Extraction Mechanism:</strong></p><p><strong>For the Peasants (No or Minimal Insurance):</strong></p><ul><li>Emergency room as primary care</li><li>Bills: $5,000-$150,000 (depending on severity)</li><li>Payment plan: $200-$500/month for years</li><li>One illness/injury = debt spiral</li><li>Effect: Cannot quit job, cannot take risks, cannot organize</li></ul><p><strong>For the Workers (Employer-Provided Insurance):</strong></p><ul><li>Premium: $200-$600/month (employee portion)</li><li>Deductible: $3,000-$7,000/year (must pay this before insurance pays anything)</li><li>Out-of-pocket max: $8,000-$15,000/year</li><li>Effect: You're insured but cannot afford to use it</li><li><strong>And you cannot quit (would lose coverage)</strong></li></ul><p><strong>For the Knights (Good Insurance):</strong></p><ul><li>Premium: $100-$300/month</li><li>Deductible: $500-$2,000</li><li>Comprehensive coverage</li><li>Effect: Healthcare is not a constraint on behavior</li></ul><p><strong>The Control:</strong></p><p>Healthcare tied to employment = cannot strike, cannot quit, cannot organize, cannot freelance, cannot start competing business.

Local Politics Are Captured</strong></p><ul><li>City councils: dominated by property owners, business owners, developers (the knights)</li><li>Planning commissions: explicitly serve \"economic development\"</li><li>Credit unions donate to campaigns (both parties)</li><li>NIMBY vs YIMBY is a false binary (both serve capital, just different visions of extraction)</li></ul><p><strong>3. Structural Constraints</strong></p><ul><li>Cities need tax revenue (incentivizes gentrification)</li><li>Credit unions have capital (cities don't)</li><li>Federal government provides carrots/sticks (highway funding, etc.)</li><li>Result: Even well-meaning politicians are constrained</li></ul><p><strong>This doesn't mean don't vote (vote for harm reduction), but it means voting alone will not free the peasants.</strong><h2></h2></p><h3>The Guardian Garden Alternative (Building Parallel Systems)</h3><p><strong>The Strategy:</strong></p><p>Don't beg the knights for scraps. Don't try to reform the system from within (you'll be captured or expelled). <strong>Build parallel systems that make the extraction system obsolete.</strong></p><p><strong>The Components:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Land Trusts (Remove Land from Speculation)</strong></p><ul><li>Community land trust buys land</li><li>Land held in commons (cannot be sold for profit)</li><li>Individuals/families own buildings, lease land ($50-100/month)</li><li>Effect: Housing stays permanently affordable</li><li>Funding: Donations, member equity, grants, ethical investors</li><li>Examples: Champlain Housing Trust (Vermont), Dudley Street (Boston)</li></ul><p><strong>2. Cooperative Enterprises (Worker Ownership)</strong></p><p>Instead of working for the resort/winery/restaurant and having surplus value extracted:</p><ul><li>Workers collectively own business</li><li>Profits shared among worker-owners</li><li>One worker, one vote (democratic)</li><li>Effect: No extraction by absentee lords</li><li>Examples: Mondragon (Spain, 80,000 workers), Cooperative Home Care Associates (NYC, 2,000 workers)</li></ul><p><strong>3. Mutual Aid Healthcare (Exit the Monastery)</strong></p><ul><li>Healthcare sharing ministries (Solidarity HealthShare, Christian Healthcare Ministries)</li><li>Direct primary care (pay doctor directly, $50-150/month, no insurance)</li><li>Community health workers (prevent crises, cost 1/10th of ER visits)</li><li>Herbal medicine, preventive care (1/100th the cost)</li><li>Effect: Exit insurance racket, reduce costs 50-80%</li></ul><p><strong>4. Alternative Education (Exit the Monastery)</strong></p><ul><li>Apprenticeships (learn while earning, not while borrowing)</li><li>Community colleges (1/10th the cost, same outcome for most careers)</li><li>Trade schools (electrician, plumber, carpenter—earn $60,000+ with zero debt)</li><li>Online learning (free/cheap, no debt)</li><li>Effect: Skip the debt bondage, still gain skills</li></ul><p><strong>5. Voucher Systems (Local Currency)</strong></p><ul><li>Local currency backed by goods/services</li><li>Circulates within community, not extractable by banks</li><li>Examples: BerkShares (Massachusetts), Brixton Pound (UK)</li><li>Effect: Keeps wealth local, prevents extraction</li></ul><p><strong>6. Seed Libraries, Tool Libraries (Sharing Economy)</strong></p><ul><li>Reduce need to buy/own everything</li><li>Build community relationships</li><li>Effect: Lower cost of living, strengthen social fabric<h2></h2></li></ul><p><strong>THE SEBASTOPOL ALTERNATIVE (What Could Have Been):</strong></p><p>Imagine if in 2010, when The Barlow was being planned, the community had done this instead:</p><p><strong>Alternative Structure:</strong></p><ul><li>Community land trust buys the 12-acre site</li><li>Worker cooperative developers build the space (local construction workers become owners)</li><li>Retail spaces rented at cost ($500-1,000/month) to local businesses</li><li>Housing above retail (40 affordable units for workers)</li><li>Community space for meetings, education, events (free/low-cost)</li><li>Powered by solar co-op (members own panels)</li><li>Financed by: community investment ($500-5,000 per member), ethical investors, grants</li></ul><p><strong>Result:</strong></p><ul><li>No credit union extraction (no 30-year interest payments)</li><li>No gentrification (housing stays affordable)</li><li>Actual community space (not boutique retail)</li><li>Local wealth stays local (cooperative model)</li><li>Workers own their livelihoods</li></ul><p><strong>Why This Didn't Happen:</strong></p><ul><li>Required organizing (takes time and effort)</li><li>Opposed by credit unions (lose profit opportunity)</li><li>Opposed by city (lower tax revenue from affordable housing vs luxury)</li><li>Opposed by developers (lower profit margin)</li><li>Community didn't know this was possible</li></ul><p><strong>But it IS possible.

Fund the Alternative Structures</strong></p><ul><li>Invest in land trusts (your money becomes land held in commons, cannot be extracted)</li><li>Invest in worker cooperatives (your money becomes collectively-owned businesses)</li><li>Fund alternative healthcare (direct primary care practices, community health workers)</li><li>Fund education alternatives (trade schools, apprenticeships)</li></ul><p><strong>2. Provide Technical Assistance</strong></p><ul><li>You have access to lawyers, accountants, planners—share this expertise</li><li>Help navigate bureaucracy (permits, licenses, regulations)</li><li>Teach financial literacy (help peasants understand extraction mechanisms)</li></ul><p><strong>3. Use Your Platform</strong></p><ul><li>You have credibility the peasants don't (sad but true)</li><li>Speak publicly about the extraction system</li><li>Name the mechanisms (credit union partnerships, company towns, debt bondage)</li><li>Model the alternative (live in a land trust, participate in cooperatives)</li></ul><p><strong>4.

This is a precise description of how wealth flows in 2025 America.</strong></p><p><strong>You have three choices:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Pretend It's Not Feudalism</strong> Keep working, keep paying, keep hoping it gets better. It won't. The extraction accelerates.</p><p><strong>2. Try to Become a Knight</strong> Hustle, grind, exploit others, accumulate enough to join the extractive class. Some will succeed. Most will break themselves trying. And even if you succeed, you've become what you hated.</p><p><strong>3. Build the Alternative</strong> Exit the extraction system. Build land trusts, cooperatives, mutual aid, local currency, parallel institutions. It's hard. It's slow. You'll be opposed by the knights and the monasteries. But <strong>it's the only path to actual freedom.</strong><h2></h2></p><p><strong>The Guardian Garden Project (essays 9989-9990) is the blueprint for Option 3.</strong></p><p>Not reform.
