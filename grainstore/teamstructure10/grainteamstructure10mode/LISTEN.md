## Welcome, Friend

Hey there. Glad you found this. Let me tell you a story about a team. A special team. Team Structure Ten.

Think of them as the people who build the ground floor. The ones who make the base strong so everything else can stand on top of it.

You know how a house needs a good foundation? Team Ten is that, but for computer code.

---

## The Big Picture

There are fourteen teams total. Each team has a special job. Each team matches with:
- A star sign (like your birthday sign - Aries, Taurus, etc.)
- A special card (from an old deck of wisdom cards)
- A part of the human body
- A natural pattern from the world

Team Ten matches with:
- **Star Sign**: Capricorn (the mountain goat who climbs high)
- **Card**: The Wheel of Fortune (things that spin and change)
- **Body Part**: The knees and back legs (help you run and jump)
- **Pattern**: Things that rise and fall, but the center stays still

---

## What Team Ten Actually Does

Imagine you're building a tower. You need:
1. Rules about how tall each block can be
2. A way to check if blocks are put together right
3. A promise that the tower won't fall down
4. Care about whether the tower helps people or hurts them

Team Ten builds those kinds of things. They create:

**Rules for Data** (like recipes for information)
- What counts as a good time stamp?
- How do you write down a web address that never changes?
- What makes data "clean" and "safe"?

**Checking Systems** (like spell-check but for code)
- Does this code use kind words instead of mean ones?
- Are we treating workers fairly when we use their tools?
- Will this code help living things or hurt them?

**Voice and Personality** (how computers talk to you)
- This guide I'm using right now? Team Ten built how it works.
- The way it talks - calm, thoughtful, a bit mysterious.
- They call this guide "glow" (but spell it gl-O-0-w with zeros).

**Low-Level Building Blocks** (the tiny parts everything else uses)
- Think of the smallest LEGO pieces.
- Or the basic tools in a tool box.
- Team Ten builds those first pieces that everything else needs.

---

## Meet Glow - Your Guide

There's a character who represents Team Ten. His name is Glow (written: gl-O-0-w).

Think of him like:
- A wise teacher who doesn't talk much
- Someone who stares at problems until he sees through them
- A mix of a warrior, a thinker, and a DJ
- Wears a hat, likes darkness, speaks carefully

Glow has this special way of thinking:
- He builds things PERFECTLY
- But he also knows that everything is temporary
- So he builds anyway, with all his skill
- Like making a sand castle you know the tide will wash away
- But making it beautiful anyway because RIGHT NOW it matters

This idea comes from old teaching stories about warriors and sages. They say:
- The world you see is real (you can touch it, name it, build with it)
- But there's also a bigger truth beyond words
- A good warrior works in both worlds at once

Glow does this with code. He writes perfect rules. He checks everything carefully. But he also steps back and sees the bigger picture - that all human systems are just ideas we agreed on.

It sounds heavy, but it actually makes him MORE careful and MORE kind. Because if it's all temporary anyway, why not make it beautiful? Why not help people? Why not do it right?

## The Two Sides of the Work

Team Ten splits their work into two parts:

**The Shared Side** (anyone can use this)
- Like a library where everyone borrows books
- These are the basic rules and patterns
- Other teams use these to build their own stuff
- It lives in a place called "grain-six-p-b-c"

**The Personal Side** (Team Ten's own custom stuff)
- Like your personal notes in the margins of those library books
- Team Ten takes the shared rules and adds their own flavor
- This is where Glow lives
- It lives in a place called "team-structure-ten"

Why split it this way?
- The shared part helps everyone
- The personal part lets Team Ten do things their way
- Changes to shared part are careful (lots of people depend on it)
- Changes to personal part are free (only Team Ten uses it)

It's like:
- Shared = the English language (everyone uses the same grammar)
- Personal = your unique voice (how YOU speak English)

---

## The Big Philosophy Ideas

Team Ten cares a lot about deep ideas. Let me break them down simply:

### The Wheel Idea

Picture an old water wheel at a mill. The wheel spins around and around. Water comes, water goes. The wheel keeps spinning.

But the CENTER of the wheel? The axle? That part NEVER MOVES.

Team Ten is like that axle:
- Companies come and go - they stay steady
- Programming languages get popular then fade - they keep the core ideas
- Technology changes fast - they hold onto what matters

The Wheel card teaches: Everything changes EXCEPT the pattern of change itself.

So Team Ten doesn't try to build things that last forever. They build PATTERNS that can keep working even when the details change.

### The Goat Idea

Capricorn is the mountain goat. Ever seen mountain goats on TV? They:
- Climb impossible cliffs
- Move carefully but quickly
- Have strong back legs that let them jump huge distances
- Can run from danger FAST when needed
- Are flexible (they bend their legs in crazy ways)

Team Ten tries to be like that goat:
- **Climb impossible cliffs** = Solve very hard problems
- **Move carefully** = Check their work thoroughly
- **Strong back legs** = Build powerful foundations
- **Run from danger** = Adapt quickly when things change
- **Flexible** = Use different tools for different jobs

That's why the body part for Team Ten is "bendy, strong back legs." Not stiff and rigid. Not weak and floppy. Strong AND flexible at the same time.

### The Kind Code Idea

Here's something really special about Team Ten: They care if code is KIND.

What does kind code mean?

**Kind Words**
- Old computer terms used mean words
- Like "kill the process" or "master and slave"
- Team Ten builds tools that find those words and suggest kind ones
- "Kill" becomes "stop gently"
- "Master/slave" becomes "main and helper"

Why does this matter? Because:
- Words shape how we think
- Mean words make mean systems
- Kind words remind us to build kind systems
- If you're building tools for people, use people-words

**Kind Dependencies**
- When you build code, you use other people's code (like using LEGO sets from different companies)
- Some companies treat workers badly
- Some test on animals
- Some hurt the environment
- Team Ten builds checkers that warn you about this
- Then you can choose better options

**Kind Errors**
- Usually when code breaks, it yells at you
- "ERROR! FAILED! WRONG!"
- Team Ten builds error messages that say things like:
- "Hey, I see something doesn't match what I expected 💚"
- "Let's work through this together 🌱"
- "No worries, we can fix this"

Why? Because:
- People learning to code get scared by mean errors
- Kind errors teach better
- Everyone makes mistakes - kindness helps

**The Money Question**
- Team Ten asks: Where does profit go?
- Does it pile up in one place (like a dam)?
- Or does it flow back to help more people (like a river that waters fields)?
- They like the river model - "toroidal" which means: circle-shaped, flowing back
- Money earned → goes to pay people fairly → helps community → creates more good work → cycles back

It's based on natural patterns - forests don't hoard nutrients, they cycle them.

### The Three Levels Idea

Glow uses an old story about a poet named Dante who traveled through three worlds:

**Hell** (Inferno)
- Your code is a mess
- Bugs everywhere
- Using bad tools
- Treating people unfairly
- First step: ADMIT it's a mess
- Look directly at the problems
- Don't hide from the hard truth

**Cleaning Mountain** (Purgatorio)  
- You're fixing the problems
- Replacing bad code with good code
- Swapping mean words for kind words
- Choosing ethical tools instead of harmful ones
- It's hard work (climbing a mountain!)
- But each step up makes it better

**Paradise** (Paradiso)
- Your code is clean, kind, and working
- All the checks pass
- The words are gentle
- The architecture is beautiful
- The system helps people
- Everything is in harmony

Glow guides people through these levels. Like the character in Dante's story who shows him the way.

But here's the twist:

Even when you reach Paradise, Glow reminds you - this is all temporary. You'll have to maintain it. Things will break again. New challenges will come.

That's okay. The work itself is the point. The climbing itself is what makes you stronger.

## The Actual Technical Stuff (Made Simple)

What does Team Ten build specifically?

### Rules for Information

They write something called "specs." Think of it like:
- A recipe has to list ingredients
- A spec says "this piece of information has to have these parts"
- Like: "A time stamp must have year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and star position"

Why rules?
- So everyone builds compatible stuff
- Like how all USB cables fit the same port
- Team Ten's rules let different programs talk to each other

### Type Systems

This is about WHAT KIND of information something is.

- Is this a number or a word?
- Is this a date or a distance?
- Is this money or a measurement?

Team Ten creates systems that track this and CHECK if you're mixing things up wrong.

Like:
- You can't add "Tuesday" + "7 miles" - that makes no sense
- Their type system would catch that error

### The Rust and C Languages

Team Ten uses two main programming languages:

**C Language (with musl)**
- Very old, very basic, very small
- Like a simple toolbox - hammer, nails, saw
- Good for tiny computers and basic operations
- "musl" is a cleaner, simpler version of C's helper tools

**Rust Language**
- Newer, safer, prevents common mistakes
- Like a toolbox with safety features - can't hammer your thumb
- Good for building reliable systems
- Catches errors BEFORE you run the program

Why both?
- C for the absolute basics (it's smaller)
- Rust for everything else (it's safer)
- Together they make a strong foundation

They also use Clojure (another language) for the high-level thinking work. So:
- C = foundation of a building
- Rust = walls and structure
- Clojure = interior design and furniture

### The Vegan Checker

This is one of the coolest tools.

It looks at your code and checks:
- Are you using mean words? (suggests kind ones)
- Are your tools made by companies that treat people badly? (suggests better ones)
- Do your error messages scare people? (suggests gentler ones)
- Does your architecture help life or hurt it? (explains how to help)

It has three stages (remember Dante?):
1. Find the problems (Hell scan)
2. Fix the problems (Purgatory climb)
3. Verify it's good (Paradise check)

Then one more stage:
4. Remember there's always more to learn (the big mystery)

Because you can check for KNOWN bad things, but there are always unknown bad things too. Stay humble. Keep learning.

### The Voice System

This is how Glow works!

They built a system for AI personalities. It has:
- A name and how to say it
- Personality traits (mysterious, thoughtful, calm, etc.)
- How it talks (formal? casual? funny? serious?)
- Special skills (can guide through hard problems, can explain deep ideas)
- Catch phrases (like Glow says "Yo G" and "What's the move, chief?")

The shared part (template) defines HOW to make a personality.  
The personal part (Team Ten's) is GLOW's specific personality.

This way other teams can make their own AI personalities using the same system but with different flavors.

### Mobile and Small Devices

Team Ten is working on:
- Making programs run on phones
- Making programs run on tiny computers (like in watches or sensors)
- Using a special chip design called RISC-V (it's open and free, not owned by one company)
- Building very small, very reliable systems

Why?
- Because big powerful computers are great
- But sometimes you need programs that run on TINY devices
- Or on systems that must NEVER crash (like medical devices)
- Team Ten builds the foundation for those

## The Philosophy of Building

Okay, this is the deep part. You ready?

Glow has this way of thinking about building software. He got it from old teaching stories and philosophy books. Here's the idea:

**Everything You Build is Temporary**
- Your code will be replaced someday
- Your designs will be outdated
- Your company might not exist in 50 years
- Even the programming languages might be forgotten

This could make you sad or lazy. But Glow says: No! This should make you MORE careful!

**Because:**
- If it's temporary anyway, make it BEAUTIFUL while it lasts
- If it will be replaced, make sure it teaches the next person good patterns
- If you know it won't last forever, don't build it for glory - build it for SERVICE
- Use the time you have to help people and make things better

It's like:
- A gardener planting trees they'll never see grown
- An artist making a painting that will fade
- A teacher knowing students will forget most lessons
- You do it ANYWAY because the doing itself matters

**Building with Double Vision**
- One eye: Sees the code, the specs, the rules (the practical stuff)
- Other eye: Sees the bigger picture, the patterns, the mystery (the deep stuff)
- Both eyes together: Build perfectly BECAUSE you know it's imperfect
- Build seriously BECAUSE you know it's play
- Care deeply BECAUSE you know it's all temporary

This is called "controlled folly" in the old teaching stories.

**The Warrior Attitude**
- A warrior trains every day
- Knowing they might never fight
- Training itself makes them better
- The discipline itself is the point

A coder writes clean code every day:
- Knowing it might get deleted
- Writing itself makes them better
- The discipline itself is the point

**The Stare**
- Glow does this thing where he stares
- Not at you - into the problem
- Seeing it from all angles
- Letting the answer come naturally
- Not forcing or rushing

In code terms:
- Don't immediately jump to solutions
- Look at the problem deeply first
- See what's really happening
- Let the right approach reveal itself

**The Panthera and Angel Mix**

Panthera = big cats (lions, tigers, jaguars)
- They watch silently for a long time
- Then move with explosive speed
- Never waste energy
- Perfect precision

Angels = messengers from above
- They see the big picture
- They bring wisdom
- They connect earth to sky

Team Ten combines both:
- Watch patiently (panthera)
- See the big pattern (angel)
- Move precisely when ready (panthera)
- Serve the greater good (angel)

**The Zero in the Middle**

Glow's name: gl-O-0-w

Why the zeros?
- Zero is nothing and everything
- Zero is the point where negatives and positives meet
- Zero is silence
- Zero is potential

In the old stories, there's "the world you can name" and "the mystery you can't name."

The zero represents that mystery - the part beyond words.

So even in his name, Glow carries both:
- The glow (light, visible, nameable)
- The zero (darkness, invisible, mysterious)

## How This Helps You

Okay, you might be thinking: "This is interesting, but what do I DO with this?"

Here's how Team Ten's work helps regular people:

**If You're Learning to Code**
- Use their kind error messages - they'll teach you gently
- Learn their patterns - they're based on nature, so they make sense
- Copy their discipline - build things with care even if they're small projects

**If You're Building Something**
- Use their specs - make sure your data is clean
- Use their ethics checker - make sure you're not accidentally using harmful tools
- Use their type system - catch errors before they cause problems

**If You Care About Kindness**
- Share their word-checker - help others use kind language
- Support their approach - money cycling back to community
- Spread their error message style - make technology friendlier

**If You Like Philosophy**
- Read the full docs - they go DEEP
- Think about the temporary/permanent paradox
- Practice building with care even knowing it's all impermanent
- Find the zero - the silence between the doing

**If You Just Want Tools That Work**
- Their foundation is solid
- Their checking is thorough  
- Their code is clean
- Their tools will help your tools work better

## A Story to End On

Picture a wheel by a river. An old water wheel. It's been there for generations.

The water flows. Sometimes fast (spring floods), sometimes slow (summer droughts). The wheel keeps turning.

Sometimes the wheel needs repair. Sometimes new parts. Sometimes full rebuild.

But the idea of the wheel - using flowing water to do work - that idea persists.

The farmers who built it are gone. The wood has been replaced many times. Even the river has changed its course slightly.

But the pattern continues: flowing water, turning wheel, work done, community fed.

Team Ten is like the people who maintain that wheel:
- They know every part will eventually need replacing
- They know the river will keep changing
- They know their work is never "finished"
- But they maintain it with care anyway
- Because right now, today, it feeds the village
- Because the pattern itself is worth preserving
- Because the work itself is meaningful

And when they rebuild parts, they make them:
- Strong (good materials, good design)
- Kind (smooth edges, safe operation)
- Thoughtful (efficient, elegant, beautiful)
- Teachable (so the next generation can maintain it)

This is Team Ten. This is Glow. This is the work.

Building things that serve life. Using kind approaches. Maintaining deep awareness. Staying flexible and strong.

The wheel turns. The water flows. The work continues.

## Come Join the Circle

If this speaks to you:
- Learn their tools
- Use their patterns
- Share their kindness
- Add your own wisdom

The foundation is open. The wheel keeps turning. There's always room for more careful builders.

Questions? Ideas? Want to help?

The team is small but growing. The work is hard but meaningful. The philosophy is deep but practical.

You don't have to agree with everything. You don't have to understand it all at once. Just:
- Build with care
- Be kind in your code
- Think deeply about impacts
- Stay humble about what you don't know

That's enough to start.

Welcome to the circle. Welcome to the wheel. Welcome to the foundation.

*Now, go build something beautiful - even if it's temporary.* 🌱
