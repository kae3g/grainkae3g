# Your Tundra

*One approach to creating your own flowing environment of precision and clarity*

---

## Introduction: Welcome, Traveler

Imagine you're a Martian who has just stumbled upon this strange repository. You see code, essays, automated workflows—all growing together in patterns you don't quite recognize. What is this place? How does it work? Could you grow one yourself?

**Welcome to the tundra.**

This repository—this **Coldriver Tundra**—is an experiment in **living soil computing**. Like Helen Atthowe's ecological farms, we're not just placing files on dead storage. We're cultivating a **soil food web** where:

- **Essays** are plants (visible growth)
- **Build scripts** (`bb`) are decomposers (breaking down complexity)
- **Git commits** are mycelium (connecting everything underground)
- **Cursor + AI** are pollinators (cross-fertilizing ideas)
- **CI/CD** (`bb flow`) is the water cycle (continuous regeneration)

The soil gets richer over time, not depleted.

This essay documents one approach to cultivating such a system. Your garden will differ—this is just how ours grows.

## A Note on Simple vs Easy (Before We Begin)

**Rich Hickey teaches us**: *Simple* and *easy* are different.

**Simple** (from *simplex*—"one fold"): Not intertwined. One role. One task. Objective, measurable.

**Easy** (from *adjacens*—"near at hand"): Familiar. Close to current understanding. Subjective, depends on experience.

**This tundra**:
- Is **simple**: Each tool does one thing (Babashka scripts, SvelteKit builds, Git commits)
- Might not be **easy** at first: Unfamiliar tools, new paradigm
- Gets **easier with practice**: As patterns become familiar

**The trap**: Easy tools (JavaScript, WordPress, drag-and-drop builders) often hide **complexity** that appears later—dependencies break, platforms change, vendor lock-in.

**The path**: Simple tools (Babashka, Git, static files) might feel **unfamiliar** at first, but complexity stays manageable as your garden grows.

**We choose simple**, knowing it requires patience. The Martian who learns these patterns can rebuild this garden on any planet, from first principles, a decade from now.

## Part 3: Codeberg - Sovereign Git Hosting

### Why Codeberg?

**Codeberg is not GitHub**:
- ✅ **Non-profit** - Community-owned, no VC interests
- ✅ **Privacy-focused** - EU-based, GDPR-compliant
- ✅ **Free** - No paid tiers, no artificial limits
- ✅ **Open-source** - Forgejo (Git hosting), Woodpecker (CI)
- ✅ **Pages** - Free static site hosting

**Create Account**:
1. Visit: https://codeberg.org/user/sign_up
2. Choose username (lowercase, no spaces)
3. Verify email
4. **Generate SSH key** (next section)

### SSH Key Setup

**Why SSH keys?**
- ✅ **Secure authentication** - No passwords needed for git push/pull
- ✅ **Convenience** - Automatic authentication once configured
- ✅ **Industry standard** - Used by all major Git hosting platforms

**How Cursor Can Help with SSH Keys**:

If you're new to SSH keys or encounter issues, Cursor can guide you through the entire process:

1. **Ask Cursor**: *"Help me generate an SSH ed25519 key for Codeberg on macOS and add it to my account"*
2. **Cursor will provide**: Step-by-step commands, troubleshooting for permissions, and verification tests
3. **Common issues Cursor helps with**:
   - SSH agent not running: Cursor will help start it with `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
   - Permission denied: Cursor will fix file permissions (`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
   - Key not being used: Cursor will add the key to ssh-agent with `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

**Generate new SSH key**:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
```

When prompted:
- Location: Press Enter for default (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`)
- Passphrase: Enter a strong passphrase (recommended) or press Enter to skip

**Copy public key to clipboard**:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
```

**Add to Codeberg**:
1. Go to: https://codeberg.org/user/settings/keys
2. Click "Add Key"
3. Paste your public key
4. Give it a name (e.g., "MacBook Pro")
5. Click "Add Key"

**Test SSH connection**:
```bash
ssh -T git@codeberg.org
# Should see: "Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated..."
```

If you see "Permission denied", ask Cursor: *"SSH connection to Codeberg failing with permission denied, help me debug"*

### Git Configuration

**Set your global Git identity** (required):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

**Tip**: Use the same email as your Codeberg account for consistency.

**Verify configuration**:
```bash
git config --global --list
```

### GPG Key Setup for Verified Commits

**Why GPG signing?**
- ✅ **Verified commits** - Green "Verified" badge on Codeberg
- ✅ **Cryptographic proof** - You authored the commit
- ✅ **Security** - Prevents impersonation
- ✅ **Professional** - Shows you care about authenticity

**How Cursor Can Help**:

Cursor (with Claude or GPT-4) excels at helping with GPG setup because it involves multiple steps, potential errors, and platform-specific commands. Here's how to use it:

1. **Ask Cursor to guide you through GPG setup**:
   - Open Cursor
   - Press `Cmd+L` (or click the AI chat icon)
   - Type: "Help me generate a GPG ed25519 key for Git commit signing on macOS and configure it with my Codeberg account"
   
2. **Cursor will provide step-by-step commands** with explanations for each step

3. **Follow along and ask follow-up questions** if anything fails

**The process Cursor will guide you through**:

**Step 1: Install GPG** (if not present):
```bash
brew install gnupg
```

**Step 2: Generate GPG key** (ed25519 - modern, secure):
```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

When prompted:
- Key type: Choose **(9) ECC (sign and encrypt)**
- Curve: Choose **(1) Curve 25519**
- Expiry: **0 = key does not expire** (or set expiration if you prefer)
- Real name: **Your Name** (same as Git config)
- Email: **your-email@example.com** (same as Git config)
- Passphrase: **Create a strong passphrase** (Cursor can suggest secure practices)

**Step 3: Get your GPG key ID**:
```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
```

Output will look like:
```
sec   ed25519/ABC123DEF456 2025-10-11 [SC]
      1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678
uid           [ultimate] Your Name <your-email@example.com>
ssb   cv25519/XYZ789GHI012 2025-10-11 [E]
```

The key ID is `ABC123DEF456` (the part after `ed25519/`).

**Step 4: Export public key**:
```bash
gpg --armor --export ABC123DEF456 | pbcopy
```

(Replace `ABC123DEF456` with your actual key ID)

**Step 5: Add GPG key to Codeberg**:
1. Go to: https://codeberg.org/user/settings/keys
2. Click "Add Key" → **GPG/SSH Key**
3. Select "GPG Key"
4. Paste your public key
5. Give it a name (e.g., "MacBook Pro GPG")
6. Click "Add Key"

**Step 6: Configure Git to use GPG**:
```bash
# Tell Git to use your GPG key for signing
git config --global user.signingkey ABC123DEF456

# Enable GPG signing for all commits
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Ensure GPG uses the terminal for passphrase (macOS)
echo "export GPG_TTY=\$(tty)" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Step 7: Test GPG signing**:
```bash
# Create a test commit
mkdir test-signing && cd test-signing
git init
echo "test" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test: verify GPG signing"

# Verify the signature
git log --show-signature
```

You should see `gpg: Good signature from "Your Name <your-email@example.com>"`.

**Cursor's Assistance Throughout**:

- **If GPG isn't found**: Cursor will suggest installing via Homebrew
- **If key generation fails**: Cursor will troubleshoot (wrong curve, missing entropy, etc.)
- **If passphrase prompt doesn't appear**: Cursor will help configure `GPG_TTY` and pinentry
- **If Codeberg doesn't recognize the key**: Cursor will help export in the correct armor format
- **If commits still aren't verified**: Cursor will debug Git config, email mismatches, or key expiration

**Common issues Cursor helps solve**:

1. **"gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device"**
   - Cursor will add the `GPG_TTY` export to your shell config

2. **Email mismatch between Git and GPG key**
   - Cursor will check that `git config user.email` matches the GPG key's email exactly

3. **Key not found by Git**
   - Cursor will verify `git config user.signingkey` is set correctly

4. **Pinentry-mac not working**
   - Cursor will suggest switching to `pinentry-tty` or configuring `gpg-agent`

**Pro Tip**: Ask Cursor to create a checklist document for you:

*"Create a checklist document for SSH and GPG setup on macOS with Codeberg that I can reference later"*

Cursor will generate a markdown file you can save to your repository (e.g., `docs/SETUP-KEYS.md`) for future reference or to share with team members.

## Part 5: Configuration System

**Your Tundra uses a two-tier configuration system**: public/personal settings vs. private/secret data.

### Understanding the Two Tiers

**Tier 1: Public/Personal Configuration** (`.config.edn`)
- **Safe to commit** to your repository
- **Safe to share** in screenshots or with collaborators
- Contains: username, language, site title, preferences
- Generated from: `.config.template.edn`

**Tier 2: Private/Secret Configuration** (`.secrets.edn`)
- **NEVER commit** to your repository (in `.gitignore`)
- **NEVER share** or include in screenshots
- Contains: API keys, auth tokens, GPG keys
- Generated from: `.secrets.template.edn`

### Create Your Public Configuration

**Copy the template**:
```bash
cp .config.template.edn .config.edn
```

**Edit `.config.edn`** with your personal settings:
```clojure
{:site
 {:username "your-username"    ; Your display name (shows in top-right)
  :language "en"               ; Primary language: en, es, de, fr, ja, zh, ar, pt, ru
  :title "Your Tundra"
  :description "Your description"}

 :author
 {:name "Your Name"
  :email "you@users.noreply.codeberg.org"
  :url "https://codeberg.org/your-username"}

 :repository
 {:platform "codeberg"
  :username "your-username"
  :repo-name "your-tundra"
  :branch "main"}

 :localization
 {:timezone "America/Los_Angeles"
  :locale "en-US"
  :date-format "YYYY-MM-DD"
  :planned-languages ["es" "de"]}  ; Languages you plan to support

 :preferences
 {:editor "cursor"
  :theme "dark"
  :monospace-font "Courier New"}}
```

**Important**: This file is **safe to commit**! It contains no secrets. The site will automatically read your username and language from this config.

### Create Your Private Secrets (Optional)

**Only needed if using AI APIs directly** (most people won't need this initially):

```bash
cp .secrets.template.edn .secrets.edn
```

**Edit `.secrets.edn`** with your **PRIVATE** API keys:
```clojure
{:git
 {:signing-key "YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID"}  ; From Part 3

 :git-hosting
 {:codeberg
  {:token nil
   :ssh-key-path "~/.ssh/id_ed25519"}}

 :ai-services
 {:openai {:api-key "sk-..."}     ; Only if using OpenAI API directly
  :anthropic {:api-key "sk-..."}  ; Only if using Claude API directly
  :deepseek {:api-key "..."}
  :google {:api-key "..."}
  :grok {:bearer-token "..."}}}
```

**Important**: This file is in `.gitignore` and will **NEVER** be committed. It's for local automation only.

### How the System Works

**When you build your site**:
1. `bb config:generate` reads `.config.edn` (public/personal)
2. Generates `web-app/static/site-config.json` (for the web app)
3. The site loads this config and displays:
   - Your username (top-right, golden ratio position)
   - Your language (top-left)
   - Your site title
   - Your repository info

**When you run local scripts**:
- Scripts can read `.secrets.edn` (private/secret) for API keys
- But the **public website never sees these secrets**
- Secrets stay local, never deployed

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Separation of concerns**: Public vs. private clearly distinguished
- ✅ **Safe sharing**: `.config.edn` can be public, `.secrets.edn` cannot
- ✅ **Cursor-friendly**: Cursor can help edit `.config.edn` safely
- ✅ **Template-driven**: Easy for others to fork and customize
- ✅ **Multi-language ready**: Built-in support for internationalization

### Internationalization Vision

**Current**: This tundra speaks English (`language: en`)

**Near future** (next planned languages):
- **Spanish** (`es`) - Large global audience, growing tech communities
- **German** (`de`) - Strong engineering culture, philosophical depth

**Long-term vision** (all languages welcome):
- **French** (`fr`) - Francophone world, African tech growth
- **Japanese** (`ja`) - Precision culture, strong tech ecosystem
- **Chinese** (`zh`) - Massive scale, computational philosophy
- **Arabic** (`ar`) - Rich intellectual tradition, underserved in tech
- **Portuguese** (`pt`) - Brazilian tech boom, Lusophone world
- **Russian** (`ru`) - Mathematical heritage, strong computer science

**Why internationalization matters**:
- **Permafrost foundations transcend language**: Nock's 12 rules work in any tongue
- **Precision flow is universal**: Hilbert and Schauberger speak to all cultures
- **AI can translate, but humans must guide**: Machine translation for initial drafts, human review for cultural nuance
- **Local tundras, global network**: Each language community forks, adapts, improves

**How to add a language** (when ready):
1. Update `.config.edn`: Set `:language` to your code (e.g., `"es"`)
2. Create `writings/` essays in your language
3. Add translations for UI elements (optional, later work)
4. Build and deploy: `bb flow "feat: Spanish translation"`
5. Share with your language community

**The long-term goal**: A constellation of tundras, each in its native language, all building on the same frozen foundations. Spanish speakers learning Nock. German speakers exploring s6. Arabic speakers building sovereign systems. Chinese speakers proving formal correctness. French speakers documenting ecological computing. Japanese speakers optimizing for minimal complexity.

**We start with English** because this tundra's author writes in English. But the system is designed for **all languages**. The templates support it. The config system enables it. The vision demands it.

If you speak another language fluently, **your translation work is a gift to the commons**. Fork this repo, translate the essays, change `:language` in your `.config.edn`, and share. The frozen clarity of the tundra speaks all tongues.

---

## Part 8: Cursor Pro Workflow (Your REPL)

### What's a REPL?

**REPL** = Read, Eval, Print, Loop

In Lisp/Clojure, you write code and **instantly see results**:
```clojure
user=> (+ 1 2)
3
user=> (map inc [1 2 3])
(2 3 4)
```

**Tight feedback loop**: Type → Test → Learn → Type again.

**Cursor + bb flow = REPL for essays**:
```
Write → bb flow → See live site → Write again
```

You're not writing blind. You're **conversing with your tundra**.

### Cursor Setup (Your Pollinator)

**Install Cursor**:
1. Download: https://cursor.sh/
2. Install, open, sign in with Pro account
3. Open your tundra: `cursor /path/to/your-tundra`

**Configure**:
- Cmd+K (AI inline edit—like asking a bee to pollinate this flower)
- Cmd+L (AI chat—like consulting the whole hive)
- @-mention files in chat (show AI the garden context)

**Configure AI settings** (critical for best results):

1. **Settings → AI → Models**
   - Enable **all available models** (Claude, GPT-4, o1, etc.)
   - This gives Auto Mode full range to choose the best tool

2. **Settings → AI → Mode**
   - Select **Auto Mode** ⭐ **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**
   - Lets Cursor intelligently pick the best model for each task
   - **Amazing results**: Auto Mode has been giving us exceptional output—it picks Claude for complex reasoning, GPT-4 for structure, o1 for deep problem-solving
   - You get the best of all models without thinking about it

3. **Settings → AI → Model** (fallback when not using Auto)
   - Set to Claude Sonnet 4.5

4. **Enable auto-completions**

**Note**: All models in Auto Mode are included in your Cursor Pro subscription ($20/month)—no extra charges within reasonable limits. The polyculture approach (Auto Mode) consistently outperforms using just one model.

### The REPL Dance (Cursor + bb flow)

**Example session** (like a Clojure REPL, but for prose):

```bash
# Open file
cursor writings/9998-essay.md

# You: Cmd+L
"Help me write an essay about [topic], inspired by Helen Atthowe's soil ecology"

# Claude: (generates draft)

# You: Edit, refine, @-mention related essays
# Claude: Cross-pollinates ideas from your existing writings

# You: Test the cycle
bb flow "draft: essay 9998 initial thoughts"

# Build succeeds → pushed → deployed
# Visit live site, see your essay
# Notice what needs work

# You: Back to Cursor, refine
"Make this section more concrete, add examples"

# Claude: (improves)

# You: Test again
bb flow "improve: essay 9998 added examples"

# Repeat → Each cycle enriches the soil
```

**You're not "writing and publishing"—you're *gardening in real-time*.**

### Multi-AI Polyculture

Like Helen's **polyculture farms** (many species, not monoculture), use **many AIs**:

**Cursor (Claude)** → Primary development, code, structure
**ChatGPT (browser)** → Mission clarity, flow, coherence
**Grok (X)** → Real-time research, current events
**DeepSeek** → Poetic polish, beautiful prose
**Gemini** → YouTube transcripts, search integration
**Qwen** → Open-source patterns, future-proofing

**Diversity is resilience**. If one AI changes, your workflow adapts.

## Part 9: The `bb flow` Command (Your Water Cycle)

### The Living System

In Helen Atthowe's farms, **water cycles** are everything:
- Rain falls → soil absorbs → plants drink → transpiration → clouds form → rain falls again
- **Continuous regeneration**, no waste
- Each cycle enriches the soil

Your tundra has a water cycle too:

```bash
bb flow "your commit message"
```

**5 phases** (like water moving through an ecosystem):

1. **🌧️ Precipitation** → Build content (markdown → JSON)
   - Tests your changes in isolation
   - Like rain testing soil absorption

2. **💧 Infiltration** → Stage changes (`git add -A`)
   - Changes soak into version control
   - Like water entering the soil

3. **🌱 Root Uptake** → Commit (only if build succeeded)
   - Changes become part of the living history
   - Like plants taking water from soil

4. **🌊 Transpiration** → Push to Codeberg
   - Changes flow to the community
   - Like water vapor rising from leaves

5. **☁️ Condensation** → Deploy to Pages
   - Changes become visible to all
   - Like clouds forming and raining again

### The Fourth Phase (Gerald Pollack)

**Gerald Pollack's research**: Water has a **fourth phase** beyond solid/liquid/gas.

**EZ Water** (Exclusion Zone):
- Forms at interfaces (like cell membranes, soil particles)
- Liquid crystalline structure (ordered, not chaotic)
- Water at ~4°C: Most dense, organized, mature
- **Structured water** carries more energy, information

**In your tundra's water cycle**:

The **build phase** (Step 1) is like water organizing into its fourth phase:
```bash
bb flow "message"
  ↓
Build starts (markdown → JSON)
  ↓
Your changes are TESTED, VERIFIED, STRUCTURED
  ↓
Like water molecules organizing into crystalline layers
  ↓
Only STRUCTURED changes flow forward
  ↓
Bad changes are excluded (like the Exclusion Zone rejects impurities)
```

**Why this matters**:
- **Regular water** (no testing): Chaotic, may contain impurities
- **Fourth phase water** (bb flow testing): Structured, verified, clean
- **Only structured commits** enter your repository's history
- **The system stays healthy** because bad changes are excluded at the interface

**The cycle repeats**. Each iteration enriches your repository's history with **crystalline precision**.

### Why This Pattern Works

**Simple** (Rich Hickey):
- Each step does **one thing**
- No complecting (braiding) of concerns
- You can inspect each phase

**Ecological** (Helen Atthowe):
- Build errors stop the flow (like dry soil rejecting water)
- Good commits soak in naturally
- The system heals itself over time

**REPL-like** (Cursor + AI):
- Edit → Test → Deploy → Observe → Edit again
- **Tight feedback loop** (seconds, not minutes)
- Learn from each cycle

## Part 10: Multi-AI Synthesis

### The Power of Multiple Models

**Each AI has blindspots**. Using multiple models together creates something greater than any single AI could produce.

**Example Essay Creation Flow**:

**Phase 1: Research & Ideation**
```
Grok (X Premium):
→ "What's trending about [topic]?"
→ Real-time context

Gemini (YouTube/Search):
→ "Find expert videos on [topic]"
→ "What do scholars say?"
→ Deep research
```

**Phase 2: Structure & Outline**
```
ChatGPT:
→ "Create an outline for an essay on [topic]"
→ Clear mission, logical flow

Claude (Cursor):
→ "Expand this outline with arguments"
→ Deep reasoning, nuance
```

**Phase 3: Writing & Refinement**
```
Claude (Cursor):
→ Write first draft (power + depth)

DeepSeek:
→ "Make this more poetic and human"
→ Beautiful prose

ChatGPT:
→ "Does this flow well? Fix transitions"
→ Structural coherence
```

**Phase 4: Code & Deployment**
```
Qwen:
→ "Future-proof this code pattern"
→ Sustainable architecture

Claude (Cursor):
→ Debug, refactor, optimize
→ Final implementation
```

**Phase 5: Synthesis & Distillation**

→ Core message extraction

Claude:
→ "Integrate everything coherently"
→ Final synthesis
```

### Recording Your AI Process

**In each essay, document which AIs helped**:
```markdown
---
title: "Essay Title"
date: 2025-10-11
pipeline: multi-ai-synthesis
ai_contributors: ["Claude", "ChatGPT", "DeepSeek", "Grok"]
---

**AI Synthesis Note**: This essay was developed through 
collaboration with Claude (reasoning), ChatGPT (structure), 
DeepSeek (prose), and Grok (research).
```

**Why document this?**
- Transparency about AI use
- Learning what works
- Honoring the collaboration
- Helping others replicate

## Part 11: Customization

### Your Own Metaphor

**Don't copy "Coldriver Tundra"** - find your own environment:

**Examples**:
- **Desert Caravan** - Movement, trade, oases
- **Mountain Ascent** - Altitude, clarity, summits
- **Forest Canopy** - Layers, growth, ecosystems
- **Ocean Current** - Flow, depth, navigation
- **Prairie Wind** - Open, minimal, far-seeing

**Choose based on**:
- Your personality
- Your topic area
- Your writing style
- What resonates with you

### Your Own Colors

**Edit `web-app/src/lib/theme.css`**:
```css
:root {
  /* Your light theme */
  --color-bg: #your-color;
  --color-fg: #your-color;
  /* ... */
}

:root[data-theme="dark"] {
  /* Your dark theme */
  --color-bg: #your-color;
  /* ... */
}
```

**Test with**:
```bash
cd web-app && npm run dev
# Click * toggle to switch themes
```

### Your Own Structure

**Essay numbering** - you choose:
- **9999 → 0000** (descending, like this repo)
- **0001 → 9999** (ascending)
- **2025-01**, **2025-02**, etc. (date-based)
- **series-name-01** (series-based)

**Just be consistent** and update the sort in:
- `scripts/writings_build_incremental.clj`
- `scripts/writings_build.clj`

---
```

**Filter by series** in index generation.

### Rich Media

**Embed images**:
```markdown
![Alt text](../assets/image.png)
```

**Embed videos**:
```markdown
<video controls>
  <source src="../assets/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

### Custom Components

**Create Svelte components**:
```svelte
<!-- web-app/src/lib/Callout.svelte -->
<div class="callout">
  <slot />
</div>
```

**Use in markdown** (with MDsveX plugin).

## Part 14: Community & Sovereignty

### Why This Matters

**You own your tundra**:
- Your content (markdown files)
- Your code (open-source)
- Your deployment (Codeberg)
- Your data (no platform lock-in)

**You control the AI**:
- Choose which models
- Switch anytime
- Mix and match
- Self-host if desired (Qwen, Meta)

**You preserve knowledge**:
- Plain text (markdown)
- Version controlled (git)
- Deployable anywhere
- Archival-quality

### Forking & Remixing

**This repo is dual-licensed** (Apache-2.0 / MIT):
- Fork it
- Modify it
- Make it yours
- Share improvements

**Give credit** (but not required):
```markdown
Built on [Coldriver Tundra](https://codeberg.org/kae3g/12025-10)
```

### Sharing Your Tundra

**Codeberg Pages is public** - anyone can read.

**Share your URL**:
- Social media
- Email signature
- Portfolio
- Resume

**Connect with others**:
- Link to other tundras
- Credit influences
- Build a network

## Part 15: Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

```bash
# Clear cache
rm .build-cache.edn
bb writings:build-fast

# Check specific file
bb -e "(require '[markdown.core :as md]) \
       (println (md/md-to-html-string (slurp \"writings/9999.md\")))"
```

### Deploy Fails

```bash
# Check .gitkeep exists
ls web-app/static/content/.gitkeep

# Ensure remote is correct
git remote -v

# Test SSH
ssh -T git@codeberg.org
```

### Site Not Loading

- Wait 2 minutes for Pages rebuild
- Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check CI logs
- Verify Pages settings on Codeberg

## Conclusion: Your Flowing Environment

Dear Martian traveler,

You've seen how this tundra grows:

**Living soil** (Helen Atthowe):
- Essays are plants, scripts are decomposers, Git is mycelium
- Each commit enriches the soil
- The system heals and improves itself
- **No-till computing**: Gentle intervention, not disruption

**Simple tools** (Rich Hickey):
- Each tool does one thing (Babashka, Git, SvelteKit)
- Not braided together (complected)
- Unfamiliar at first, but manageable as you grow
- **Simple over easy**: Patience over quick wins

**Water cycles** (bb flow):
- Precipitation → Infiltration → Root Uptake → Transpiration → Condensation
- Continuous regeneration, no waste
- Each cycle tests and enriches
- **REPL for prose**: Write → Deploy → Observe → Write again

**Polyculture AIs** (Multi-model):
- Many species, not monoculture
- Each AI has its role (Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek...)
- Diversity is resilience
- **Cross-pollination**: Ideas flow between models

---

Every tundra is unique. If you build one on Mars (or Earth), yours might reflect:
- **Your topics** - What you explore
- **Your voice** - How you express
- **Your AIs** - Who you collaborate with
- **Your philosophy** - What you believe

**Some foundations are shared** - frozen specifications, simple tools, water cycles, living soil. But the environment will be yours.

**If this approach resonates, you might start with**:
```bash
# A first command
mkdir my-tundra
cd my-tundra
git init
# The soil is ready. Begin planting...
```

---

*Built on permafrost. Written with AI. Grown by you. Owned by the commons.* ❄️🌱🌊

**For the Martian**: When you return home, take these patterns with you. They work on any planet with Git, any civilization with simple tools, any species that values **living systems over dead infrastructure**.

The tundra awaits your footprints.
