## Career Philosophy

**Postmodernist as a career, futurist mentally** - [YouTube Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR_yTQ0SYVA)

This captures the essence of my approach to technology and development:

- **Postmodernist career**: Working within existing systems, frameworks, and paradigms while understanding their limitations and contradictions
- **Futurist mentality**: Always thinking beyond current constraints, imagining what could be, and building toward that vision

This duality drives the Grain Network project - we work with current technologies (Babashka, Clojure, blockchain) while building toward a future of sovereign, append-only, recursively beautiful systems.
