## 🔧 **Part 1: Dual-Display Architecture (30 minutes)**

### **What is Dual-Display Technology?**

Dual-display technology uses two different types of screens on a single device:

#### **Primary Display (Front)**
```clojure
(def primary-display
  {:type "OLED/AMOLED"
   :size "6.7 inches"
   :resolution "1440×3200 pixels"
   :refresh-rate "60-120Hz"
   :use-cases ["Android UI" "Media" "Gaming" "Video calls"]
   :power-consumption "High"
   :battery-life "8-12 hours"})
```

#### **Secondary Display (Back)**
```clojure
(def secondary-display
  {:type "E-ink"
   :size "10.3 inches"
   :resolution "1200×825 pixels"
   :refresh-rate "1-3Hz"
   :use-cases ["Reading" "Writing" "Battery conservation"]
   :power-consumption "Minimal"
   :battery-life "3-7 days"})
```

### **Why Dual Displays?**

#### **Advantages**
- **Battery Efficiency**: E-ink uses 99% less power than OLED
- **Outdoor Visibility**: E-ink works perfectly in sunlight
- **Specialized Use Cases**: Different screens for different tasks
- **Extended Battery Life**: Switch to e-ink for reading/writing

#### **Challenges**
- **Cost**: Two displays increase manufacturing cost
- **Complexity**: More components to manage
- **Software**: Need to support both display types
- **Weight**: Additional screen adds weight

### **Student Activity: Design Your Own Dual-Display Device**

**Instructions:**
1. Choose a device (phone, tablet, laptop, etc.)
2. Design two displays with different purposes
3. Explain why each display is needed
4. Consider power consumption and use cases
5. Present your design to the class

**Example Student Project:**
```
Device: Smart Watch
Primary Display: Color OLED for notifications and apps
Secondary Display: E-ink for always-on time and health data
Reasoning: OLED for rich interactions, e-ink for battery life
```

## 🌱 **Part 2: Sustainable Materials and Environmental Design (20 minutes)**

### **Hemp Composite Materials**

The Grainphone uses **hemp composite** for its case:

#### **What is Hemp Composite?**
```clojure
(def hemp-composite
  {:base-material "Industrial hemp fiber"
   :binding-agent "Bio-based epoxy resin"
   :reinforcement "Carbon fiber strands"
   :fiber-content "60% hemp, 30% carbon, 10% resin"
   :sustainability "100% renewable, carbon negative"
   :biodegradability "90% in 5 years (compostable)"})
```

#### **Environmental Benefits**
- **Carbon Negative**: Absorbs more CO2 than it produces
- **Renewable**: Grows quickly without pesticides
- **Biodegradable**: Breaks down naturally
- **Strong**: Comparable to fiberglass

### **3D Printing for Repairability**

#### **Why 3D Printing?**
- **User Replaceable**: Print parts at home
- **Customizable**: Modify designs for personal needs
- **Local Manufacturing**: Reduce shipping and waste
- **Educational**: Learn manufacturing processes

#### **Materials Used**
```clojure
(def printing-materials
  {:petg "Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol - Strong and flexible"
   :pla "Polylactic Acid - Biodegradable but less durable"
   :abs "Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene - Very strong"
   :tpu "Thermoplastic Polyurethane - Flexible and rubber-like"})
```

### **Student Activity: Sustainable Design Challenge**

**Instructions:**
1. Design a case for a smartphone using sustainable materials
2. Consider: strength, weight, cost, environmental impact
3. Research materials: bamboo, hemp, recycled plastic, etc.
4. Create a materials specification sheet
5. Present your design with environmental impact analysis

## 💰 **Part 3: Crowdfunding Strategy and Business Planning (25 minutes)**

### **What is Crowdfunding?**

Crowdfunding is raising money from many people to fund a project:

#### **Types of Crowdfunding**
- **Reward-Based**: Backers get products or rewards
- **Equity-Based**: Backers get ownership shares
- **Debt-Based**: Backers loan money with interest
- **Donation-Based**: Backers donate without expecting returns

### **Crowdfunding Platforms**

#### **Crowd Supply**
```clojure
(def crowd-supply
  {:focus "Hardware and technology"
   :fee "5% platform fee"
   :audience "Technical enthusiasts"
   :duration "60 days typical"
   :success-rate "Higher for hardware projects"})
```

#### **Kickstarter**
```clojure
(def kickstarter
  {:focus "Creative projects and technology"
   :fee "5% platform fee + 3-5% payment processing"
   :audience "General public"
   :duration "45 days typical"
   :success-rate "Variable, depends on marketing"})
```

### **Grainphone Crowdfunding Strategy**

#### **Campaign Goals**
- **Crowd Supply**: $500,000 (400 units)
- **Kickstarter**: $750,000 (650 units)
- **Total Target**: $1,250,000

#### **Pricing Strategy**
```clojure
(def pricing-strategy
  {:basic-model
   {:retail "$1,299"
    :crowd-supply "$1,199 (early bird)"
    :kickstarter "$1,149 (super early bird)"
    :profit-margin "$99 per unit"}
   
   :pro-model
   {:retail "$1,799"
    :crowd-supply "$1,699 (early bird)"
    :kickstarter "$1,649 (super early bird)"
    :profit-margin "$599 per unit"}})
```

### **Student Activity: Create Your Own Crowdfunding Campaign**

**Instructions:**
1. Choose a product to crowdfund (real or imaginary)
2. Set a funding goal and timeline
3. Create reward tiers for different pledge amounts
4. Write a compelling campaign description
5. Design marketing materials (poster, video script, etc.)

**Example Student Project:**
```
Product: Smart Backpack with Solar Charging
Goal: $50,000 in 30 days
Rewards:
- $25: Thank you note + sticker
- $75: Early bird backpack (50% off)
- $150: Backpack + solar panel
- $300: Backpack + solar panel + power bank
```
