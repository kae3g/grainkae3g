---

## Introduction: The Big Picture (15 minutes)

### What We Built Last Time

In Lesson 5, we discovered that **80 and 110 work together perfectly** to create Grainframes - digital "pages" that feel natural and comfortable.

Today, we're taking it further: **How do we share these Grainframes across the internet?**

### The Challenge

Imagine you write a beautiful poem in your Grainwriter device:
- It's 80 characters wide
- It's 110 lines tall
- It's exactly 8,800 characters

**Questions**:
1. How do you send it to a friend?
2. How do you display it on a website?
3. How do you show it on a phone app?
4. How do you ensure it looks the same everywhere?

**Answer**: We need a **type system** and a **network protocol**!

### Real-World Analogy

Think of sending a package via mail:
- **Content**: Your poem (the actual data)
- **Envelope**: The Grainframe format (80×110)
- **Address**: A URL-safe path (where it goes)
- **Label**: A Mark type (what kind of data it is)
- **Shipping Method**: Network protocol (how it travels)

Today we'll build all of these!

---

## Part 1: Type Systems - Why They Matter (20 minutes)

### What Is a Type?

A **type** tells you what kind of data you have and what you can do with it.

**Examples**:
```clojure
;; Number type
(def age 16)
;; You can add, subtract, multiply numbers

;; String type
(def name "Alice")
;; You can concatenate, search, split strings

;; Grainframe type
(def my-poem {:grainframe-id "..."
              :grainframe-content "..."
              :grainframe-metadata {...}})
;; You can display, send, save Grainframes
```

### Why Types Are Like Traffic Signs

Without types, code is like driving without road signs:
- You don't know what's coming
- Mistakes happen easily
- Chaos ensues!

With types:
- ✅ You know what data you have
- ✅ You know what operations are valid
- ✅ You catch errors before they happen
- ✅ Other people understand your code

### The Mark System (Inspired by Urbit)

In the Grain Network, we use **Marks** - networked type definitions:

```clojure
;; A Mark is like a passport for data
{:mark-name "text-grainframe"           ; What is it?
 :mark-version "1.0.0"                  ; Which version?
 :mark-spec ::grainframe                ; What's the structure?
 :mark-validator #(valid? %)            ; How to check it?
 :mark-serializer #(pr-str %)           ; How to send it?
 :mark-deserializer #(read-string %)}   ; How to receive it?
```

**Key Insight**: Marks let us send data across the network **safely and reliably**.

---

## Part 2: Clay Filesystem - Immutable Paths (25 minutes)

### The Problem with Regular File Paths

Normal file systems:
```
/home/alice/documents/my-poem.txt
```

Problems:
- ❌ Files can be deleted
- ❌ Files can be modified
- ❌ Hard to share across computers
- ❌ No version history

### Clay: Immutable, Versioned Paths

Inspired by Urbit's Clay filesystem, we use **Grainpaths**:

```
ship/desk/revision/path
```

Example:
```
kae3g/main/1.0.0/poems/midnight-thoughts.txt
```

Breaking it down:
- **ship**: Who owns this? (`kae3g`)
- **desk**: Which workspace? (`main`)
- **revision**: Which version? (`1.0.0`)
- **path**: Where is it? (`poems/midnight-thoughts.txt`)

**Key Properties**:
1. **Immutable**: Once published, never changes
2. **Versioned**: Each change gets a new revision number
3. **URL-safe**: Works in web addresses
4. **Networked**: Can be shared across computers

### Activity: Build a Clay Path

**Challenge**: Create a Clay path for your Grainframe

```clojure
(ns clay-explorer
  (:require [clotoko.sur.clay :as clay]))

;; Your username (ship)
(def my-ship "student-alice")

;; Your workspace (desk)
(def my-desk "homework")

;; Version number
(def my-revision "1.0.0")

;; File path
(def my-path ["essays" "my-first-grainframe.txt"])

;; Create a complete Clay beam (ship + desk + revision + path)
(def my-beam
  {:clay-ship my-ship
   :clay-desk my-desk
   :clay-revision my-revision
   :clay-path my-path})

;; Convert to URL-safe string
(println "My Clay path:")
(println (clay/clay-beam->string my-beam))
;; Output: student-alice/homework/1.0.0/essays/my-first-grainframe.txt
```

**Try It Yourself**:
1. Change `my-ship` to your name
2. Create different paths for different assignments
3. Increment the revision number when you make changes

## Part 3: Grainclay - The Package Manager (30 minutes)

### What Is a Package Manager?

You've probably used:
- **App Store** (iOS)
- **Google Play** (Android)
- **Steam** (Games)

These are all package managers! They:
1. Let you install software
2. Keep software updated
3. Manage dependencies
4. Handle versions

### Grainclay: Rolling Release for Grainframes

**Grainclay** is our package manager that:
- Watches Grainpaths for changes
- Automatically updates content
- Uses immutable versioning
- Works with Mark types

**Architecture**:
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Grainwriter   │  (Your device)
│    80×110       │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ watches
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   Grainclay     │  (Package manager)
│    Daemon       │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ syncs from
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Clay Network   │  (Distributed storage)
│ Immutable Paths │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Building a Simple Watcher

```clojure
(ns grainclay-demo
  (:require [clojure-s6.grainclay :as grainclay]
            [clotoko.sur.clay :as clay]))

;; Define what we want to watch
(def watched-beam
  {:clay-ship "kae3g"
   :clay-desk "lessons"
   :clay-revision "1.0.0"
   :clay-path ["course" "lesson-06.md"]})

;; Create a callback function that runs when content changes
(defn on-content-change
  [change-info]
  (println "📢 Content updated!")
  (println "  Old version:" (:old-revision change-info))
  (println "  New version:" (:new-revision change-info))
  (println "  Syncing new content..."))

;; Start watching!
(def watcher-id
  (grainclay/watch-grainpath! watched-beam
                              on-content-change
                              :poll-interval-ms 5000))

;; This will check every 5 seconds for updates!

;; To stop watching:
;; (grainclay/stop-watcher! watcher-id)
```

### Student Activity: Package Manager Simulation

**Scenario**: You're publishing homework assignments

1. **Create** a Grainframe with your essay
2. **Publish** it to a Clay path (version 1.0.0)
3. **Make edits** and publish version 1.0.1
4. **Watch** as your teacher's device automatically gets the update!

**Code Template**:
```clojure
;; Step 1: Create Grainframe
(def my-essay
  (grainframe/create-grainframe
   "My essay content here..."
   :type :document
   :title "Why I Love Programming"
   :author "Alice"))

;; Step 2: Create Clay path
(def essay-beam
  {:clay-ship "alice"
   :clay-desk "homework"
   :clay-revision "1.0.0"
   :clay-path ["essays" "programming-love.txt"]})

;; Step 3: Package for distribution
(def my-package
  {:package-name "alice-essay-1"
   :package-version "1.0.0"
   :grainpath-beam essay-beam
   :package-description "My programming essay"})

;; Step 4: Register package
(grainclay/register-package! my-package)

;; Step 5: Teacher watches for submissions
(grainclay/watch-grainpath! essay-beam
                            (fn [change]
                              (println "Student submitted:" (:new-revision change))))
```

## Part 4: Cross-Platform Publishing (25 minutes)

### The Ultimate Goal

Write **once**, publish **everywhere**:
- 📱 Mobile app (iOS/Android)
- 💻 Desktop app (Linux/Mac/Windows)
- 🌐 Website (Svelte)
- 🖥️ Native Grainwriter device

### The Transformation Pipeline

```
Original Grainframe (EDN)
        ↓
   Mark Validator
        ↓
   ┌────┴────┐
   │         │
   ▼         ▼
Website   Native App
(Svelte)  (Humble UI)
```

### Step-by-Step: Grainframe to Web

**1. Start with a Grainframe** (EDN format):
```clojure
{:grainframe-id "abc123"
 :grainframe-content "My poem goes here..."
 :grainframe-metadata
 {:grainframe-type :poem
  :grainframe-title "Midnight Thoughts"
  :grainframe-author "Alice"
  :grainframe-timestamp #inst "2025-01-22T10:00:00Z"}}
```

**2. Validate with Mark**:
```clojure
(def my-frame-mark
  (grainframe/grainframe->mark my-grainframe))

;; Check if valid
(if (:valid? my-frame-mark)
  (println "✅ Ready to publish!")
  (println "❌ Fix errors first!"))
```

**3. Convert to Markdown** (for website):
```clojure
(defn grainframe->markdown
  [grainframe]
  (let [meta (:grainframe-metadata grainframe)
        content (:grainframe-content grainframe)]
    (str "---\n"
         "title: " (:grainframe-title meta) "\n"
         "author: " (:grainframe-author meta) "\n"
         "type: " (name (:grainframe-type meta)) "\n"
         "---\n\n"
         content)))

;; Result:
;; ---
;; title: Midnight Thoughts
;; author: Alice
;; type: poem
;; ---
;;
;; My poem goes here...
```

**4. Svelte Component** (for website):
```svelte
<!-- Grainframe.svelte -->
<script>
  export let title;
  export let author;
  export let content;
  export let type;
</script>

<article class="grainframe" data-type={type}>
  <header>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p class="author">by {author}</p>
  </header>
  <pre class="content">{content}</pre>
</article>

<style>
  .grainframe {
    width: 80ch;  /* 80 characters */
    max-height: 110em;  /* 110 lines */
    font-family: monospace;
    background: #fefefe;
    padding: 1rem;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
  }
  
  .content {
    white-space: pre-wrap;
    font-size: 1rem;
    line-height: 1.5;
  }
</style>
```

**5. Native App** (Humble UI for desktop):
```clojure
(defn grainframe-view
  [grainframe]
  (ui/column
    (ui/padding 16
      (ui/column
        ;; Title
        (ui/label (:grainframe-title (:grainframe-metadata grainframe))
                  {:font-size 24 :font-weight :bold})
        
        ;; Author
        (ui/label (str "by " (:grainframe-author (:grainframe-metadata grainframe)))
                  {:font-size 14 :color :gray})
        
        ;; Content (80×110 grid)
        (ui/text-area (:grainframe-content grainframe)
                      {:width (* 80 8)     ; 80 chars * 8 pixels
                       :height (* 110 12)  ; 110 lines * 12 pixels
                       :font-family :monospace
                       :read-only true})))))
```

### The Magic: One Source, Many Destinations

```clojure
(defn publish-everywhere
  [grainframe]
  
  ;; 1. Validate
  (when (grainframe/grainframe-valid? grainframe)
    
    ;; 2. Convert to Markdown for website
    (let [markdown (grainframe->markdown grainframe)]
      (spit "website/content/posts/my-post.md" markdown))
    
    ;; 3. Save as EDN for native apps
    (let [edn (pr-str grainframe)]
      (spit "apps/data/grainframes/my-post.edn" edn))
    
    ;; 4. Publish to Clay network
    (let [beam {:clay-ship "alice"
                :clay-desk "published"
                :clay-revision "1.0.0"
                :clay-path ["posts" "my-post.edn"]}]
      (grainclay/sync-package! beam))
    
    (println "✅ Published to all platforms!")))
```

## Part 5: Hands-On Project (30 minutes)

### Build Your Own Grainweb Post

**Assignment**: Create a Grainframe that publishes to multiple platforms

**Step 1**: Write your content (pick one):
- A. A poem about technology
- B. A short story (exactly 8,800 characters)
- C. An explanation of something you learned today
- D. ASCII art with a message

**Step 2**: Structure it as a Grainframe:

```clojure
(ns my-grainweb-post
  (:require [clotoko.sur.grainframe :as grainframe]
            [clotoko.sur.clay :as clay]
            [clotoko.sur.mark :as mark]))

;; Your content
(def my-content
  "Write your content here...
   Remember: 80 characters wide max!
   And 110 lines tall max!")

;; Create Grainframe
(def my-grainframe
  (grainframe/create-grainframe
   my-content
   :type :post  ; or :poem, :document, etc.
   :title "My Amazing Post"
   :author "YourName"
   :tags ["lesson6" "grainweb" "homework"]))

;; Create Clay path
(def my-beam
  {:clay-ship "yourname"
   :clay-desk "grainweb"
   :clay-revision "1.0.0"
   :clay-path ["posts" "my-amazing-post.edn"]})

;; Validate
(println "Valid?" (grainframe/grainframe-valid? my-grainframe))

;; Get Mark info
(def my-mark (grainframe/grainframe->mark my-grainframe))
(println "Mark:" (:mark my-mark))
(println "Valid for network?" (:valid? my-mark))

;; Convert to Markdown
(defn grainframe->markdown [gf]
  (let [meta (:grainframe-metadata gf)]
    (str "---\n"
         "title: " (:grainframe-title meta) "\n"
         "author: " (:grainframe-author meta) "\n"
         "tags: " (pr-str (:grainframe-tags meta)) "\n"
         "type: " (name (:grainframe-type meta)) "\n"
         "date: " (str (:grainframe-timestamp meta)) "\n"
         "---\n\n"
         (:grainframe-content gf))))

(println "\n=== MARKDOWN OUTPUT ===")
(println (grainframe->markdown my-grainframe))
```

**Step 3**: Test the transformation

```clojure
;; Test: Can it become a Grainweb post?
(def grainweb-post
  {:post/id (:grainframe-id my-grainframe)
   :post/title (get-in my-grainframe [:grainframe-metadata :grainframe-title])
   :post/content (:grainframe-content my-grainframe)
   :post/type :grainframe
   :post/timestamp (get-in my-grainframe [:grainframe-metadata :grainframe-timestamp])
   :post/author "YourName"
   :post/tags (get-in my-grainframe [:grainframe-metadata :grainframe-tags])})

(println "\n=== GRAINWEB POST ===")
(clojure.pprint/pprint grainweb-post)
```

## Part 6: Advanced Concepts (15 minutes)

### The Type Theory Behind Marks

**Haskell Equivalents** (for advanced students):

```haskell
-- In Haskell, types are explicit:
type GrainframeId = String
type Content = String
type Timestamp = UTCTime

data GrainframeType = Text | Poem | Document | Message
  deriving (Show, Eq)

data GrainframeMeta = GrainframeMeta
  { metaType :: GrainframeType
  , metaTimestamp :: Timestamp
  , metaAuthor :: Maybe String
  , metaTitle :: Maybe String
  } deriving (Show, Eq)

data Grainframe = Grainframe
  { grainframeId :: GrainframeId
  , grainframeContent :: Content
  , grainframeMetadata :: GrainframeMeta
  } deriving (Show, Eq)
```

**Clojure Spec Equivalent**:

```clojure
(s/def ::grainframe-id string?)
(s/def ::grainframe-content (s/and string? #(<= (count %) 8800)))
(s/def ::grainframe-type #{:text :poem :document :message})

(s/def ::grainframe-metadata
  (s/keys :req-un [::grainframe-type
                   ::timestamp]
          :opt-un [::author
                   ::title]))

(s/def ::grainframe
  (s/keys :req-un [::grainframe-id
                   ::grainframe-content
                   ::grainframe-metadata]))
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Types prevent bugs
- Types document your code
- Types enable tooling (autocomplete, validation)
- Types make networking safe

### Network Protocol Design

When Grainframes travel over the network:

```clojure
;; Sending
{:operation :sync
 :grainframe-id "abc123"
 :grainframe {...}  ; The actual data
 :clay-beam {...}   ; Where it came from
 :mark-type "post-grainframe"  ; What type it is
 :timestamp #inst "2025-01-22T10:00:00Z"
 :checksum "a1b2c3..."  ; Verify integrity
}

;; Receiving
{:operation :response
 :request-id "req789"
 :grainframe {...}
 :status "success"
 :timestamp #inst "2025-01-22T10:00:01Z"}
```

This ensures:
1. **Reliability**: Did it arrive correctly?
2. **Authenticity**: Is it from who it claims?
3. **Integrity**: Was it modified in transit?
4. **Versioning**: Which version is this?

### What You've Learned

1. **Type Systems**: Mark types ensure data correctness
2. **Immutable Paths**: Clay filesystem for versioned, shareable content
3. **Package Management**: Grainclay watches and updates automatically
4. **Cross-Platform**: One Grainframe → Many platforms
5. **Network Protocol**: Safe, reliable data transfer

### Why This Is Revolutionary

**Traditional Publishing**:
- Write in Word
- Convert to PDF
- Email to everyone
- Someone edits? Start over!

**Grain Network Publishing**:
- Write once in Grainframe
- Publish to Clay path
- Everyone watches automatically
- Updates sync seamlessly
- Works on all platforms

## Teacher Notes

### Key Concepts

1. **Types**: What data IS and what you can DO with it
2. **Immutability**: Once published, never changes
3. **Versioning**: Track changes over time
4. **Cross-Platform**: Write once, publish everywhere
5. **Network Protocol**: How data travels safely

### Real-World Connections

- **Git**: Similar to Clay's versioning
- **npm/pip/cargo**: Similar to Grainclay package management
- **REST APIs**: Similar to network protocol
- **Markdown**: Similar to cross-platform publishing

### Common Challenges

1. **"Why not just use files?"**
   - Answer: Versioning, immutability, network sharing

2. **"This seems complicated"**
   - Answer: Start simple, build up complexity gradually

3. **"When would I use this?"**
   - Answer: Any time you want to share content reliably
