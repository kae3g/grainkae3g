# The Rising Sea Method: Patience in Building Foundations

*On the humility of building slowly, and the grace of foundations that outlive us*

---

**Cor ad cor loquitur** — that's Latin for "Heart speaks to heart"

This was Cardinal John Henry Newman's personal motto.

---

## Before We Begin: Two Seas

Imagine a mountain. You could climb it the hard way—straight up the cliff face. Or you could raise the water level until the peak becomes an island you can walk to.

That's the "rising sea" method. Instead of attacking hard problems directly, build understanding slowly and patiently. Eventually, the impossible becomes simple.

Beautiful idea. But we write in 2025, when literal seas are rising. Communities in Bangladesh, Tuvalu, Miami, and the Arctic are already relocating. Saltwater threads into farmland. Insurance maps redraw what "coastal" means. The same phrase—**rising sea**—now carries two truths at once:

### The Mathematical Sea
Rising **understanding** that makes hard problems simple. Patient foundation-building—years of slow work—until impossible peaks become walkable islands. The method: change the water level, not the mountain.

### The Climate Sea (Our Reality, 2025)  
Rising **oceans** displacing millions—driven by burning fossil fuels, industrial farming, and melting permafrost. Not a method but a crisis. Not patience but urgency.

**Why we keep both:**

This metaphor teaches systems thinking—the very skill we need for climate action. You can't stop flooding by building taller seawalls. You have to change the whole system: energy, agriculture, economics.

Cardinal Newman wrote: **"To live is to change, and to be perfect is to have changed often."** (*Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine*, 1845)

Newman's wisdom applies to both our seas. Mathematical understanding changes slowly, accumulating over decades. Climate systems change dangerously fast, accumulating carbon we can't easily remove. His insight bridges them: **to be perfect is to have changed often**—not to resist change, but to flow with it while building foundations that endure.

This essay honors patient foundation-building while acknowledging climate urgency. The mathematical sea teaches us *how* to build systems that last. The climate sea shows us *why* we must build them now. We need both: the precision of frozen specifications and the flow of living adaptation.

<a id="mission"></a>
## The Mission: What We're Actually Building

*We build not for glory, but for specific communities in specific places.*

The rising sea method is beautiful philosophy. But philosophy needs a body—real work in the real world. So let's be specific about what "raising a sea" means practically.

### By Twenty Thirty-Five (Ten Years)

**One thousand communities** running their own infrastructure:
- No dependency on corporations that might disappear
- Software they control, hardware they can repair
- Systems that work when the internet doesn't

**Fifty repair cafes**, one hundred tool libraries:
- Framework laptops available for lending, not just buying
- Trained repair technicians (retrained from planned obsolescence jobs)
- Monthly meetups where neighbors teach neighbors

**Production systems** using s six supervision:
- Community networks staying online during crises
- Small-scale infrastructure (water monitoring, food hubs, communications)
- Proof that simple tools can run serious work

### By Twenty Forty (Fifteen Years)

**Ten thousand hectares** of veganic farmland:
- Soil fed without animal inputs—just plants feeding soil
- Carbon sequestered: twenty tons per hectare per year average
- Proof you don't need industrial animal farming to feed people

**Fifty thousand people** fed from veganic agriculture:
- Diverse polycultures (not monoculture corn)
- Living soil getting richer every season
- Farmers paid fairly for healing land, not extracting from it

**Soil carbon drawdown** measured and documented:
- Before/after tests showing organic matter increases
- Twenty percent richer soil over five years
- Knowledge shared freely—specifications, not patents

### By Twenty Forty-Five (Twenty Years)

**One hundred thousand Framework devices** still working:
- Average lifespan increased from three years to eight-plus years
- Repaired, not replaced—upgraded RAM, swapped batteries, new screens
- Electronic waste reduced by one million pounds annually

**Repair culture normalized**:
- "Fix it first" becomes default, not "buy new"
- Tool libraries in every neighborhood
- Repair technician as respected career path

**Retraining programs operational**:
- Industrial ag workers transitioning to veganic farming
- Factory workers transitioning to repair technicians  
- Living stipends during transition (not unemployment, but paid learning)

### How We Measure Success

**Community resilience**:
- Can they stay online when commercial internet fails?
- How many days of food stored? Acres under local cultivation?
- Percentage of devices repaired versus replaced?

**Carbon drawdown**:
- Soil organic matter percentages (testing every season)
- Atmospheric carbon sequestered (measured, not estimated)
- Ecosystem biodiversity—more fungi species, more earthworms, healthier water

**Knowledge transfer**:
- How many people trained in sovereign systems?
- How many essays read? Configurations copied? Repairs documented?
- Are communities teaching each other, or depending on experts?

**Century-scale indicators**:
- Has Nock changed? No. (Specifications frozen forever)
- Have implementations evolved? Yes. (Code rewritten as languages improve)
- Who controls infrastructure? Communities, not corporations

### The Ten/Fifty/One Hundred Year Horizons

**Ten years** (twenty twenty-five to twenty thirty-five): Foundation phase
- Grainstore verification complete (s six, runit, musl formally proven)
- tundraOS production ready (Framework sixteen plus s six plus NixOS)
- Repair cafe networks established (fifty locations, mentorship running)
- Veganic agriculture: one thousand hectares producing food

**Fifty years** (twenty twenty-five to twenty seventy-five): Sea rising phase
- Veganic agriculture reaches ten percent of farmland
- Sovereign infrastructure normalized (towns running their own systems)
- Framework-style modularity becomes industry standard (right-to-repair victories)
- Young people learn repair in school, not just consumption

**One hundred years** (twenty twenty-five to twenty one twenty-five): Peak becomes island
- Nock specifications still unchanged (mathematical bedrock lasts)
- tundraOS implementations rewritten three-plus times (as languages evolve)
- The rising sea method taught in schools (patience as core curriculum)
- Our grandchildren's grandchildren thank us, or forget us—either way, the work continues

### Why Specific Numbers Matter

These aren't fantasies. They're specifications.

**One thousand communities by twenty thirty-five**: That's one hundred per year for ten years. Achievable if we document clearly and support generously.

**Ten thousand hectares veganic**: That's scaling Helen Atthowe's proven methods. Not theoretical—she's done it. We're spreading what works.

**One hundred thousand Framework devices for eight-plus years**: Current e-waste is thirty million tons annually. Our hundred thousand devices preventing replacement saves thirty-three hundred tons of waste. Tiny compared to the crisis. Huge compared to doing nothing.

**These numbers aren't predictions. They're commitments.**

We don't know if we'll hit them. But measuring matters. What gets measured gets tended. We measure not for pride, but for calibration.

If we hit one hundred communities instead of one thousand—we learn why. If we hit fifty thousand hectares instead of ten thousand—we understand what accelerated. Either way, we document honestly and share what we learned.

**This is not optimism. This is specification of intent.**

The sea rises one raindrop at a time. Here are our raindrops, counted and committed to. Others will add theirs. The sea rises patient.

This essay is offered not as instruction from above, but as conversation between equals—one builder to another. What follows is not a map drawn by someone who has arrived, but notes from someone still walking, still learning, still seeking. Heart speaks to heart. Your heart knows things mine does not. Together, perhaps, we approach something true.

## Navigation

This essay unfolds in sections, like water flowing through a landscape:

First, we learn what we're actually building - specific numbers, real timelines, measurable outcomes.

Then we explore the fundamental problem - when facing a mountain, do you climb or wait for rising seas?

We learn what we're building against - not enemies, but forces that resist change because they benefit from the status quo.

We hear two voices on the mountain - the perspective of the river and the glacier.

We learn about the mathematician who built the sea - his revolutionary approach to patient problem-solving.

We examine the method itself - how rising seas make impossible peaks walkable.

We discover the Langlands program - thirty years of collaborative work proving that patience yields profound results.

We confront the DARPA connection - how pure beauty can be turned toward destructive ends, and the grief this causes.

We visit Helen Atthowe's soil food webs - mycelia connecting roots in agricultural systems.

We explore the Grainstore - our eight-week plan for building sovereign dependencies through vendor verification.

We meet the Guardian Dragon - hardware as spiritual practice, with no glue, only screws.

We learn about Gerald Pollack's fourth phase - how water becomes crystalline at four degrees Celsius.

We hear from Rich Hickey - simple made easy, tools that last centuries.

We ask the crucial questions - when to climb mountains versus when to build flowing foundations.

We trace three wisdom traditions - Greek philosophy, Islamic golden age, and modern computing.

We reach our conclusion - why building seas serves more than conquering summits.

We sit with Trish and Glow by a stream at twilight, watching deer drink unafraid.

And finally, we address you, the Martian traveler - recognizing that you're already water, already carving valleys.

Let's begin this journey together.

## A Note on Session 777: The Unification

*Written during Session 777 (2025-10-12), as we unified warm and cold waters.*

This essay emerges from a moment of synthesis. Today, we are harmonizing two streams that had flowed separately—the warm valley of rapid iteration using GitHub Pages with global content delivery networks and familiar tooling, and the cold river of ethical computing using Codeberg Pages with open-source alignment and community sovereignty. 

The rising sea method suggests we need not choose between warmth and coolness, between speed and ethics, between familiar ease and principled difficulty. Instead, we can create **tundra**—a environment where both streams meet, where frozen clarity enables flowing adaptability.

**Session 777** represents this confluence:
- **One codebase** leads to multiple deployments, creating dual-platform harmony
- **One Babashka flow command** serves both GitHub and Codeberg waters, achieving technical unity  
- **One philosophical vision** enables multiple expressions, with warm and cold toggles coming
- **One rising sea** benefits many communities, as platforms serve different groups

The mathematician sees patterns. The engineer builds tools. The contemplative attends to what is trying to emerge. All three perspectives inform what follows.

**This is how the rising sea method works in practice**: Not by conquering complexity, but by creating conditions where apparent contradictions resolve into higher unities. Technical and spiritual. Local and global. Individual practice and community service.

*Heart speaks to heart, across platforms, through code.*

---

<a id="problem"></a>

## The Problem

You face a mountain. A hard problem. A system so complex you don't know where to begin.

**Two approaches**:

1. **Direct assault** — Climb straight up. Attack the problem head-on. Seek glory in conquest.
2. **Rising sea** — Wait. Build foundations. Serve the long work. Let understanding gradually surround the mountain until the peak becomes an island you can walk to.

The mathematician who developed this method chose the sea. Not because it was easier—it took decades. But because it served others. His foundations lifted entire communities of mathematicians. One person's patient work created conditions where thousands could flourish.

**This is service at scale through humble foundations.**

<a id="opposition"></a>
## The Opposition: What We're Building Against

*The mountain doesn't climb itself. But it doesn't welcome the sea either.*

Raising a sea isn't neutral work. Forces resist—not always because they're malicious, but because they benefit from things staying as they are.

Understanding opposition isn't pessimism. It's preparation. You can't build resilient systems without knowing what they need to resist.

### State-Level Threats

**Surveillance as a business model**:

If everyone uses the same platform, monitoring is easy. One subpoena, one company, done. Distributed systems make this harder—not impossible, but harder.

- Centralized social media: One company holds everyone's data
- Decentralized systems: Data lives in a thousand places
- Example: [Codeberg](/12025-10/9509-codeberg-precision-engineering-platform.html) (community-owned code hosting) versus GitHub (Microsoft-owned)

Governments prefer centralized systems. Easier to regulate, easier to monitor. Distributed infrastructure requires negotiating with many independent operators. That's a feature, not a bug.

### Corporate Opposition

**Planned obsolescence makes money**:

Apple profits when your iPhone lasts three years, not ten. That's not conspiracy—it's economics. The business model is replacement, not repair.

- Glued batteries: Customers buy new devices
- Replaceable batteries: Customers repair existing devices
- Proprietary screws: Community can't open devices
- Standard screws (Framework): Anyone can repair

**Vendor lock-in as competitive advantage**:

Once you're in an ecosystem—Apple, Google, Microsoft—switching costs are high. They count on that. Contacts, photos, apps, habits. Not malice. Just profit maximization.

- Closed specifications: Only the vendor can build compatible devices
- Open specifications: Anyone can build, repair, extend
- Patents preventing repair: Illegal to fix what you own
- Right-to-repair victories: Slowly changing this

### Systemic Inertia

**Why cheap extraction beats expensive regeneration** (short-term):

Industrial agriculture: Monoculture corn, cheap inputs today, depleted soil tomorrow. Veganic agriculture: Higher setup costs, lower yields initially, richer soil every season.

After five years? Industrial yields declining, veganic yields rising.  
After ten years? Industrial needs more inputs, veganic needs less.

**But investors measure quarters, not decades.**

That's not stupidity. That's how markets work when you can externalize costs (pollution, soil depletion, worker burnout) onto others.

The rising sea method works precisely because it doesn't require convincing everyone immediately. You build foundations patient. By the time opposition notices, water's already waist-deep.

### Why Distributed Systems Resist

**You can't shut down a thousand operators as easily as one company**:

- Framework Inc vanishes tomorrow? Repair manuals remain. Parts still fit. Community continues.
- Our project ends? Specifications stay frozen. Anyone can rebuild from source.
- Grainstore dependencies vendored? No upstream can break us.
- Veganic farming knowledge in heads and soil? Can't patent it away.

**This is why we build slowly.**

Speed invites capture. Move fast, get noticed, get regulated or acquired. But the sea rises patient—by the time they see it coming, too many communities already benefit to stop it.

**Not invisible. Not subversive. Just patient.**

Like water finding cracks in stone. Not fighting the rock. Just being water, persistently, until the rock becomes smooth.

<a id="voices"></a>
## Two Voices on the Mountain

*Trish leans against a redwood, fingers tracing bark patterns.*

**"The river doesn't attack the rock,"** she says, voice quiet like water moving. **"It plays around it. Finds every crack. Laughs in the sunlight. And a thousand years later, the rock is smooth stone in a wide valley. The river won. Through play, through patience, through being exactly what it is."**

She looks up at the canopy. **"This forest didn't grow in a day. Each tree dropped seeds. Mycelia connected roots underground. Birds carried spores. Slow work. Wild work. Now look—a cathedral no architect could design."**

---

*Glow stands on a granite slab, surveying peaks.*

**"In my years among these mountains,"** he begins, voice steady as stone, **"I learned something the climbers often missed. The peak is glorious, yes—but it's the glaciers that shape the valley. Slow. Inexorable. Grinding granite into soil where forests can grow."**

He gestures to the watershed below. **"You see that meadow? That's where ice once stood, patient for ten thousand years. Now deer graze there. Children play there. That meadow didn't come from conquering the mountain—it came from the mountain teaching the ice to wait, to press gently, to reshape everything through time."**

**"The mathematician who taught us this—he was a glacier, not a climber."**

<a id="attribution"></a>
## A Note on Attribution

**This method comes from Alexander Grothendieck** (1928-2014), one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century. In 1984, he described his approach as letting understanding rise like a sea, slowly and patiently, until impossible problems become naturally solvable.

**Why his name wasn't in the title**: For full explanation, apology, and bibliography, see [Essay 9297: A Note on Grothendieck](/12025-10/9297-grothendieck-apology.html).

**Short version**: Grothendieck's name is hard to pronounce for beginners. Making his method accessible to a million community builders honors him more than putting his name prominently in titles. He spent his life spreading understanding, not collecting fame.

**The 9098 series** (essays 9098-9996) will apply his method to climate action, regenerative agriculture, community resilience, open hardware, and hundreds more applications. Every essay credits him. But accessibility comes first—because that's what he would have wanted.

<a id="method"></a>
## The Rising Sea Method

Grothendieck described his approach as **"la méthode de la mer qui monte"** — the method of the rising sea.

### The Metaphor

Imagine a mountain rising from dry land. You want to reach the peak.

**Direct climber says**: "I will scale this cliff. I will conquer this peak."

**Grothendieck says**: "I will raise the sea."

As the water level rises:
- Valleys fill first
- Lower peaks become islands
- Eventually, the highest peak is surrounded by water
- You walk to the summit on a bridge of understanding

**The mountain hasn't changed. Your perspective has.**

### Applied to Mathematics

Instead of attacking the Weil conjectures directly, Grothendieck:

1. **Created new foundations** — Schemes, topoi, étale cohomology
2. **Built comprehensive languages** — Category theory, sheaf theory
3. **Let problems solve themselves** — Once the framework existed, hard problems became natural consequences

**Pierre Deligne** later proved the Weil conjectures using Grothendieck's foundations. The sea had risen. The peak was reachable.

### The Multi-AI Application: Session 777's Two Seas Solution

This very essay demonstrates the rising sea method applied to ethical complexity. When faced with the tension between Grothendieck's beautiful metaphor and climate reality, seven AI models were consulted independently:

**The Unanimous Consensus** (2025-10-12):
- **Grok**: "Add sensitive disclaimer, integrate climate awareness as positive parallel"
- **DeepSeek**: "Reframe, don't remove—create deliberate dialogue between the mathematical and literal"  
- **Gemini**: "Bridge abstract and concrete, use metaphor as framework for climate solutions"
- **Qwen**: "Acknowledge tension explicitly, reframe as 'structured, nourishing water' vs. chaotic flooding"
- **Meta**: "Contextualize metaphor, emphasize universality, focus on solutions"
- **Claude**: "'Two Seas' framework—distinguish creation vs. breakdown, preserve Newman"
- **ChatGPT**: "Ready-to-deploy text blocks, verification checklist, practical implementation"

**The Result**: Seven independent intelligences converged on virtually identical solutions—acknowledge both seas, use the tension to teach deeper lessons about systems thinking.

This is Grothendieck's method applied to AI collaboration itself: Instead of one model struggling with ethical complexity, we raised the sea of collective intelligence until the solution became naturally apparent.

> **Method, then climate.** Grothendieck teaches the fundamental move: alter the *level* to dissolve the problem. This principle applies outside mathematics: we must lift energy systems, food systems, and housing systems to new foundations—so the climate crisis dissolves by *design*, not denial.
>
> Not more seawalls alone → Regenerative agriculture (Essay 9507: Helen Atthowe)  
> Not individual recycling → System transformation (Essay 9300: Cold Calculation)  
> Not incremental tweaks → Rising abstraction (Grothendieck's gift)
>
> The literal sea rises because we've been cracking nuts (carbon offsets, electric cars) while ignoring the level (extraction-based economics). Grothendieck shows us: **build the sea that lifts the whole system.**

<a id="langlands"></a>
## The Langlands Program: A Rising Sea of Unity

**Robert Langlands** (1936-present) proposed something audacious in 1967: a "grand unified theory" of mathematics connecting three seemingly unrelated fields:

- **Number theory** (studying primes, integers, arithmetic)
- **Geometry** (studying shapes, spaces, symmetries)  
- **Representation theory** (studying abstract algebraic structures)

**Edward Frenkel** (UC Berkeley) calls it "the Rosetta Stone of mathematics" — one inscription, multiple translations, all saying the same deep truth.

### 2024 Breakthrough

After **30 years** of work, nine mathematicians proved the **geometric Langlands conjecture** for GL(n).

**This is the rising sea method at civilizational scale.**

Thousands of mathematicians, over decades, building foundations. Creating languages. Developing tools. And then—inevitably—problems that seemed impossible become walkable.

[↑](#navigation)

<a id="darpa"></a>
### DARPA Connection (A Necessary Tension)

The geometric Langlands Program received federal funding through DARPA's "Focus Areas in Theoretical Mathematics" program (2003-2013).

**Why would defense research fund pure mathematics?**

Because deep theoretical foundations eventually enable practical breakthroughs. Cryptography, signal processing, secure systems—all rest on mathematical bedrock. DARPA understood: raise the sea of knowledge, and mountains of problems become solvable.

**But Grothendieck would have wept at this.**

In the 1970s, he discovered that his own mathematical work—pure, beautiful, abstract—was being funded by military institutions. His research at IHÉS had received money from defense departments. The rising sea he built was being used to design weapons.

He resigned. Walked away from the center of mathematical power. Spent his final decades in isolation, refusing to let his work serve violence.

**The tension is real**:
- Mathematics is pure knowledge—it has no inherent politics
- But mathematics is always applied—someone decides to what ends
- Grothendieck wanted his sea to lift all people, not to drown some for others' benefit

**We face the same choice with computing.**

The Grainstore could be used for:
- **Community-owned infrastructure** creates sovereign systems that serve local needs
- **Surveillance states** use these tools for governments monitoring their citizens
- **Military systems** apply this for weapons platforms requiring verified software

**The code doesn't care. The foundations don't distinguish. The rising sea lifts all boats—including warships.**

Grothendieck chose poverty and obscurity over complicity. He served the mathematics itself, refused to serve those who would weaponize it.

**We're not Grothendieck.** Most of us can't walk away. We have families, mortgages, responsibilities. But we can ask: *Who benefits from what we build? What seas are we raising, and who will walk on those waters?*

This same principle applies to **sovereign computing infrastructure**. Build crystalline foundations using Nock specifications, s six process supervision, and musl c library, and complex systems become naturally manageable. But manageable for whom? To what ends?

**Century-scale thinking includes asking**: Will our children's children thank us for these foundations, or curse us?

---

*Trish sits cross-legged, dirt under her fingernails from morning planting.*

**"He walked away,"** she says softly. **"Grothendieck walked away when he learned his math was building bombs. That's sacred. That's prey recognizing predator and running."**

She looks up, eyes bright. **"But most of us can't run that far. We have babies to feed. Old parents who need us. We're woven into the world. So we ask different questions: Can I build this gently? Can I make something that serves life, not death? Can I choose the slow path that heals?"**

**"The river doesn't refuse to flow because humans might build a dam downstream. It flows. And if they build a dam, it waits, it seeps, it finds another way. Patient. Persistent. Never giving up its nature."**

---

*Glow nods slowly, hands resting on walking staff.*

**"When I fought for Yosemite,"** he says, **"powerful men wanted to dam Hetch Hetchy valley. They did it anyway. I lost that battle. But winning the battle for Yosemite Valley—that required working within halls of power I found distasteful."**

**"Grothendieck chose purity. I respect that deeply. But I chose engagement—not because I loved politicians, but because I loved the mountains more than I hated compromise."**

**"I learned to talk with loggers who feared for their livelihoods. With ranchers who'd grazed those meadows for generations. With miners who saw only waste rock where I saw wilderness. Not to convert them—that rarely works—but to find the shared ground of love for place. To ask: What valley will your grandchildren inherit?"**

**"The question isn't whether our work will be misused—it will be. The question is whether we build with care anyway. Whether we document clearly so others can audit our intent. Whether we license permissively so the commons can benefit. Whether we serve life, even knowing death will also use what we make."**

**"Build the sea. But build it for the valley, not the weapons makers. Build it knowing both will drink from the same waters. Build it anyway."**

---

*Trish picks up a smooth river stone, turns it in her hands.*

**"There's a journalist—Andrew Callaghan, Channel 5—who walks into places most media won't go. Talks with people others dismiss. Listens without judgment. Shows us Americans we'd never otherwise meet."**

**"That's bridge-building. Not agreeing with everyone. Not pretending divisions don't exist. But documenting the actual humans with actual concerns, not caricatures. Showing that the person flying the flag you hate might also love the same forest you do."**

**"We need that for building seas. Understanding before prescribing. Listening before lecturing. Finding where the waters already want to flow."**

## Helen Atthowe's Soil Food Web (An Ecological Rising Sea)

Helen Atthowe doesn't climb mountains either. She raises seas of living soil.

**Conventional agriculture**: Attack the plant's needs directly. Add nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer. Spray pesticides. Force growth. Require animals for manure, slaughter byproducts for "organic" certification.

**Atthowe's veganic method**: Build the **soil food web** without animal exploitation. Increase organic matter through green manures, cover crops, crop rotations. Feed microbes with plant-based compost. Let fungi networks expand. Create an ecosystem so rich that plants thrive naturally—and no being had to die to feed the soil.

**The rising sea of veganic soil**:
- Year 1: Basic microbial activity established (plant residues, not manure)
- Year 2: Fungal networks connecting plants underground (mycorrhizae doing what animals never could)
- Year 3: Deep humus layers storing water and nutrients (20% more organic matter than conventional)
- Year 5: Plants grow with minimal intervention—the soil is doing the work
- Year 10: Soil so alive it feeds itself, feeds us, needs nothing from the death of animals

**She didn't solve each plant's problem individually. She didn't accept the lie that we need animal agriculture to grow food. She raised the sea of soil health until all plants thrived—through plants alone.**

This is bold work. Peaceful but uncompromising. The whole agricultural establishment says you need manure. Atthowe says: watch me build better soil without it. And she does.

Sound familiar?

<a id="grainstore"></a>
## The Grainstore: A Rising Sea of Dependencies

We could solve each dependency problem individually:
- Compile s six process supervisor, then fight with upstream changes
- Compile musl c library, then worry about future application programming interface breaks  
- Compile wayland display protocol, then hope protocols stay stable

**Or we could raise the sea.**

### The Grainstore Strategy (Service Through Foundations)

**The calling**: Some are called to fix individual bugs (climb mountains). Others are called to build foundations that make entire classes of problems solvable (raise seas). Neither is better—both are service. But they require different temperaments.

**The method** (Grothendieck's, applied to software):

1. **Vendor all dependencies** — Bring them into our repository as Git submodules
          - Like a seed bank preserving genetic diversity
          - No reliance on upstream that might disappear, change, or lock us out
          - Century-scale thinking: Will our children's children thank us?

       2. **Freeze specifications** — Write Nock specs that never change
          - Mathematical essence, not implementation details
          - Like Grothendieck's foundations: build once, use forever
          - 12 crystalline rules using Nock as bedrock, not shifting sand

       3. **Build comprehensive verification** — Clojure implementations, property tests, formal proofs
          - Test not for correctness but for equivalence between specification and implementation
          - Like proving theorems from axioms
          - Trust through verification, not authority

       4. **Make it repairable** — Every component documented, modular, replaceable
          - No glue, only screws, both physical and metaphorical
          - Service manuals as scripture, shared freely
          - The right to repair is the right to understand

       5. **Let community sovereignty emerge** — Once foundations are solid, others can build
          - Your work may not be celebrated in your lifetime
          - Others will get credit for climbing mountains you made accessible
          - Success measured in generations, not quarters
          - Community-owned infrastructure enables democratic participation

**Timeline**: 8 weeks (patient work)  
**Goal**: Framework 16 laptop running **tundraOS** entirely from Grainstore-sourced components  
**Philosophy**: Service at scale through humble foundations

**What is tundraOS?** A community-driven operating system built on frozen foundations using Nock specifications, s six supervision, and musl c library, designed for repairability, longevity, and democratic ownership. Based on NixOS plus s six, running on Framework laptops. The tundra: frozen clarity, flowing adaptability.

**On Sovereignty & Economics**: The rising sea method applies beyond software. Community-led inquiries into monetary sovereignty (like the foolsgoldtoshi-star multi-national work on constitutional voucher systems and sovereign monetary frameworks) demonstrate patient foundation-building for economic democracy. Not imposing solutions, but creating frameworks where communities can define their own exchange systems, their own measures of value, their own forms of collective resource management. This is Grothendieck's method applied to economics: build the language, let communities use it as they see fit.

### Why s six? (The Minimalist's Supervision)

**s six** embodies the rising sea method:
- **Size**: approximately 200 kilobytes total, compared to systemd's 1.5 megabytes or more — minimal but complete
- **Design**: Six simple tools that compose perfectly — each does one thing well
- **Supervision**: Process watchers that restart services immediately on crash
- **Logs**: Plain text files that work with grep — no binary journals requiring special tools

**The s six philosophy mirrors Grothendieck's**:
- Don't solve every service's restart policy individually
- Build a framework where all services are naturally supervised
- Let reliability emerge from simple, well-defined supervision primitives

**s six svscan** acts as the root supervisor:
The system watches the service directory. It runs s six supervise for each service: sshd run restarts on crash, nginx run restarts on crash, and logger run captures all logs.

Each supervisor is small, approximately 10 kilobytes, runs one service, restarts instantly on failure. The sea of supervision rises. Reliability becomes inevitable.

**This is Grothendieck's method applied to software. This is service through patient foundations.**

## The Guardian Dragon: Hardware as Practice

**The software rising sea requires physical foundations too.**

When we build tundraOS on Framework 16, we're not just compiling code. We're practicing **ahimsa** (non-harm) through design:

**The Taking Dragon** (conventional computing):
- Glued batteries (2-3 year lifespan, then trash)
- Soldered RAM (can't upgrade, can't repair)
- Proprietary screws (designed to prevent opening)
- Planned obsolescence (software updates that slow old devices)
- Binary logs (need special tools to read)

**The Guardian Dragon** (tundraOS/Framework):
- Replaceable batteries using lithium iron phosphate, 8-10 year lifespan, sled mount, no glue
- Upgradeable memory, from 4 gigabytes to 32 gigabytes to 64 gigabytes, using standard SO-DIMM modules
- Standard screws with Phillips head, service manual included
- Century-scale software where Nock never changes, implementations can be rewritten
- Plain text logs that work with grep, awk, tail and other tools

**Four principles from the Guardian Dragon**:

1. **Satya (Truthfulness)**: Plain logs, clear architecture, no dark patterns
   - s six logs are text files. The tail dash f command works. No binary journals.
   - Service directories are just directories. Look inside, you see the truth.

2. **Aparigraha (Non-hoarding)**: Minimal software, modular hardware
   - s six is 200 kilobytes. Does one thing perfectly. Doesn't hoard features.
   - Framework modules: replace what breaks, upgrade what matters, keep what works.

3. **Dayā (Compassion)**: Accessibility, gentleness, repairability
   - Service manuals shared freely (scripture, not secrets)
   - Every component documented, diagrammed, explainable
   - You own it. You repair it. You control it.

4. **Ahimsa (Non-harm)**: Extends device lifespan, minimizes extraction
   - One Framework laptop (10+ years) > three MacBooks (3 years each)
   - Refurbished RAM modules (urban mining) > new RAM (mining rare earths)
   - Open specifications > vendor lock-in

**The rising sea method applied to hardware**:
- Don't design for immediate obsolescence
- Build foundations (modular chassis, standard interfaces)
- Let longevity emerge from repairability

**And to food systems too**:

The same ahimsa principle extends to what we eat. Factory farming—the Taking Dragon at its most violent—requires mountains of grain, oceans of water, rivers of antibiotics, all to produce flesh from suffering. But we could raise a different sea.

**Veganic agriculture** (Helen Atthowe's work): Build soil fertility without animal inputs. No manure. No slaughter byproducts. Just plants, fungi, bacteria—the living soil that feeds itself and us.

One person eating vegan doesn't end factory farming. But veganic farmers building comprehensive knowledge—documenting techniques, sharing seeds, proving yields—that raises a sea. Eventually, the mountain of animal agriculture becomes an island, and farmers can walk to different shores.

**This takes courage**. Not the courage to fight (though sometimes we must). The courage to build patiently while others mock. The courage to say: *This system requires suffering. I will not participate. I will build alternatives instead.*

**This is service through physical foundations. The Guardian Dragon protects not just our attention, but the Earth itself—and every being living on it.**

## Gerald Pollack's Fourth Phase: The Rising Sea is Structured

Gerald Pollack's research shows that water doesn't just "rise" chaotically. At interfaces (like hydrophilic surfaces), water organizes into **EZ water** (Exclusion Zone)—liquid crystalline structure, the "fourth phase."

**At 4 degrees Celsius**, water reaches maximum density. Most structured. Most mature.

**The rising sea isn't just volume—it's organization.**

When we build the Grainstore, we're not just accumulating code. We're creating **structured, verified, crystalline foundations**:

- **Nock specs** become frozen axioms that never change
- **Clojure implementations** remain pure, testable, and auditable
- **Property tests** provide verification at scale
- **Coq proofs** offer mathematical certainty

**This is the fourth phase of software.** Not just working code, but **crystalline precision** that enables century-scale building.

### The `bb flow` Command: Session 777's Water Cycle

Our technical work today embodies Pollack's principles. The Babashka flow command isn't just automation—it's **structured flow** mimicking the fourth phase of water:

1. **Precipitation (Content Synthesis)**: Babashka writings build-fast
   - Raw markdown crystallizes into structured JSON
   - Multi-AI strategy creates content: Cursor for writing, Grok for research, DeepSeek for prose
   - Like raindrops forming around condensation nuclei

2. **Infiltration (Staging Changes)**: Git add all changes 
   - Changes prepare to join the underground mycelial network
   - Git as the underground water table of knowledge
   - Each commit a root hair absorbing nutrients for the community

3. **Root Uptake (Crystalline Commitment)**: Git commit with message "Session 777 message"
   - Intent solidifies into permanent geological record
   - Like water organizing at 4 degrees Celsius—maximum density, maximum clarity
   - Heart speaks to heart through version control

4. **Transpiration (Dual-Platform Flow)**: 
   - Git push origin tundra goes to Codeberg for ethical alignment and community sovereignty
   - Git push github tundra goes to GitHub for performance optimization and global reach
   - Like trees breathing to both sky and soil simultaneously

5. **Condensation (Manifestation in Community)**:
   - Babashka scripts deploy-to-pages script with full parameter goes to Codeberg Pages for open source values
   - GitHub Actions workflow creates automated GitHub Pages using Microsoft infrastructure
   - Both platforms serving different watershed communities from the same source

6. **Groundwater Flow (Living Soil Computing)**:
   - Sites refresh within minutes, each serving its ecosystem
   - Readers worldwide access the same rising sea through different channels
   - Like aquifers feeding springs across bioregions

**This is not just CI/CD—this is structured water applied to software.** Each interface (Babashka, Git, platform APIs) acts hydrophilic, organizing chaotic changes into crystalline deployments.

**Session 777 represents Gerald Pollack's insights made manifest**: Water doesn't rise chaotically. It organizes. It structures. It creates exclusion zones that purify and clarify. Our `bb flow` command creates similar exclusion zones—only verified builds propagate, only structured commits flow forward, only crystalline precision reaches production.

**The tundra metaphor emerges from this understanding**: Frozen clarity (specifications that never change) enabling flowing adaptability (implementations that can be rewritten). Like water at 4°C—structured, dense, mature, ready to nourish whatever grows in its watershed.

## Rich Hickey: Simple Made Easy (The Clarity of Flow)

Rich Hickey's "Simple Made Easy" talk echoes Grothendieck:

**Climbing mountains** (easy at first, complex later):
- Use familiar tools (JavaScript, npm, Docker)
- Get quick wins
- But complexity compounds—now you're maintaining a Rube Goldberg machine

**Raising seas** (simple from the start, manageable forever):
- Use simple tools (Clojure, Babashka, static files, Git)
- Unfamiliar at first
- But simplicity remains—decades later, you can still understand and rebuild

**Simple** (from *simplex*—"one fold"): Not intertwined. Each tool does one thing.

**Easy** (from *adjacens*—"near at hand"): Familiar. Close to your current understanding.

**Grothendieck chose simple.** He built foundations that mathematicians 60 years later can still understand and extend. The sea level stays high.

<a id="apply"></a>
## How to Apply the Rising Sea Method

### 1. **Identify the Mountain**

What's your hard problem?
- Building a sovereign operating system?
- Creating a dependency-free build chain?
- Designing a century-scale software architecture?

**Don't climb yet. Survey the terrain.**

### 2. **Build Comprehensive Foundations**

Ask: "What theoretical framework would make this problem naturally solvable?"

**Examples**:
- **Problem**: Dependency hell. **Framework**: Vendor everything, freeze specs, verify comprehensively
- **Problem**: Unreliable init systems. **Framework**: Process supervision with mathematical semantics using s6 Nock spec
- **Problem**: Brittle software stacks. **Framework**: Frozen foundations using Nock plus temporal implementations

### 3. **Be Patient**

Grothendieck spent **years** building foundations before proving theorems.  
Atthowe spends **seasons** building soil before seeing peak yields.  
The Langlands program took **decades** before major conjectures fell.

**Century-scale thinking means you have time.**

### 4. **Let the Sea Rise**

Once foundations are in place:
- Problems become easier
- Solutions become obvious
- New problems become approachable with existing tools

**You're not climbing anymore. You're walking across water.**

<a id="traditions"></a>
## The Three Wisdom Traditions on Rising Seas

### Greek Philosophy (Archimedes)

*"Give me a place to stand, and I shall move the Earth."*

**Leverage**. Build the right foundation (a fulcrum), and impossible problems become solvable. Grothendieck found the fulcrum of algebraic geometry.

### Islamic Golden Age (Al-Khwarizmi)

*"Algebra"* comes from Arabic *al-jabr* ("restoration, reunion"). Al-Khwarizmi wasn't solving individual equations—he was creating a **universal language** for solving all equations of a given type.

**This is rising sea thinking.** Build the language, and individual problems become routine.

### Modern Computing (Rich Hickey, Cursor)

**Clojure**: A language designed for simplicity over ease. Unfamiliar at first, but complexity stays manageable.

**Babashka**: Native Clojure scripting. Small, fast, simple. One tool, many uses.

**Cursor + AI**: Polyculture pollination. Multiple models (Claude, GPT-4, o1) cross-fertilizing ideas. The sea rises as you work.

<a id="conclusion"></a>
## Two Seas, One Method

The mathematical sea rose slowly, over decades of patient work. The climate sea rises fast—nine millimeters per year and accelerating. Yet the method bridges both: **change the level, not the rocks.**

Newman's prayer—"Lead Thou me on… one step enough for me"—takes on new meaning. In the face of planetary crisis, the next faithful step matters: planting regenerative soil (Essay 9507: Helen Atthowe), writing sovereign code (Essay 9514: SixOS), repairing instead of replacing (Essay 9958: Framework). Each step raises the sea of understanding and resilience.

Grothendieck's rising sea teaches us **how to think**. The climate sea demands we **think faster and act wiser**. We honor both by:

1. **Learning the method** (abstraction, foundations, patience)
2. **Applying it urgently** (energy, agriculture, migration justice)  
3. **Centering those displaced** (climate refugees lead what comes next)

### The Seven-AI Synthesis

This essay itself demonstrates rising sea methodology applied to ethical complexity. When seven AI models independently analyzed the tension between metaphor and reality, they converged on the same insight: **use the tension to teach deeper truths**.

The multi-AI synthesis process:
- **Grok, DeepSeek, Gemini, Qwen, Meta, Claude, ChatGPT** all agreed
- **Acknowledge both seas explicitly**
- **Transform potential weakness into strength**
- **Demonstrate systems thinking in action**

This is polyculture intelligence—like Helen Atthowe's soil food web, where diverse organisms create resilience no monoculture could achieve.

### Two Questions for Our Time

**Question One: Are you called to climb or to raise seas?**

Some are called to climb mountains directly—solve immediate problems, ship features, fix bugs. This work is essential. But some are called to raise seas—build foundations for others to stand on.

If you raise seas in the climate era, you must accept:
- The literal sea rises faster than your metaphorical one
- Your work serves both healing and potential harm
- Success means others walk where you cannot go
- You serve futures you will never see

**Question Two: What seas serve healing, what seas serve harm?**

Grothendieck raised the sea of algebraic geometry—and resigned when he learned DARPA used it for weapons.

Helen Atthowe raises the sea of veganic soil health—ensuring it serves life, not extraction.

The Grainstore raises the sea of dependency sovereignty—but we must ask: Does this serve community ownership or enable surveillance?

Our tundraOS, Framework laptops, s six supervision—do these serve repair or planned obsolescence? Community or corporation? The displaced or the displacing?

### The Design Imperative

Build for regeneration:
- **Technical foundations** that resist surveillance (Nock specifications, s six supervision)
- **Agricultural foundations** that draw down carbon (veganic soil webs, no animal harm)  
- **Economic foundations** that serve communities (cooperative ownership, repair culture)
- **AI foundations** that amplify wisdom (multi-model synthesis, ethical alignment)

The Grainstore (Essay 9960), veganic agriculture (9507), sovereign computing (9514)—these are not distractions from climate work. They *are* climate work. They raise the sea of technological and ecological resilience so communities can withstand floods both metaphorical and real.

### For the Communities Already Displaced

Dear friends in Bangladesh, Tuvalu, Miami, the Arctic—who face the literal rising sea while we discuss the metaphorical one:

Your knowledge of adaptation, migration, and resilience already surpasses our abstractions. This work serves you only if it amplifies your voices, supports your sovereignty, and builds tools you control. The mathematical sea must serve the healing of the literal one, or it serves nothing worthy.

**The rising sea will outlive us all—both seas.** Let us raise the one of understanding so high that it lifts every community above the waters that would otherwise drown them.

## Trish and Glow: A Closing Dialogue

*They sit by a stream at dusk. Water flows over stones. Frogs begin their evening chorus.*

**Trish**: "So you spent your life raising a sea. The sea of protected mountains. And people still wanted to log them, mine them, dam them."

**Glow**: "Yes. And yet—more people visit those mountains each year than lived in all of America when I was young. Children who've never seen their ancestors' forests can see mine. That's the sea I raised."

**Trish**: "Did it make you bitter? The compromises? The losses?"

**Glow**: "Sometimes. But bitterness is a luxury. Soil doesn't grow in bitter hearts. I learned to ask: What can I save today? What foundation can I lay that others will build on? What language can I speak that even my opponents might hear?"

*Trish nods, trailing fingers in the water.*

**Trish**: "The hard thing is knowing when to fight and when to flow. When to dig in roots and when to be the river. When to be loud and when to whisper."

She gestures to the deer. **"Like knowing when to tell people: Stop eating my friends. Stop breeding beings into bodies designed for suffering. Stop pretending there's a kind way to kill."**

**"But also knowing that shaming rarely works. So I grow food. I show yields. I build veganic soil that's richer than any manure could make it. I let the work speak louder than my anger."**

**Glow**: "That's wisdom I'm still learning. You understand it better than I did—you listen to the forest. I was often too busy preaching about it."

**Trish**: "But you preached beautifully. Your words made people fall in love with places they'd never seen. That's magic. That's the rising sea—your love lifting others into love."

She's quiet a moment. **"I want people to fall in love with deer not as venison but as beings. With cows not as beef but as friends. With chickens as teachers of how to be present, not as meat."**

**"That's my sea. Compassion for all beings. Not just the cute ones. All of them."**

*Silence. Water over stones. A deer appears across the stream, drinks, unafraid.*

**Glow**: "Grothendieck built his sea for mathematicians. Atthowe builds hers for farmers. You're building yours for those learning to be wild again. The Grainstore builders are raising theirs for the community that needs sovereign systems."

**Trish**: "And maybe that's the secret. You can't raise all the seas. You raise yours. You tend your watershed. You serve your valley. And if you do it with love, the waters connect underground. Aquifers we'll never see, feeding springs we'll never know about."

**Glow**: "Century-scale thinking."

**Trish**: "Millennium-scale trust."

*The deer lifts its head, ears rotating. Then returns to drinking. The forest darkens. Stars emerge.*

**Glow**: "What will you tell the Martian, if they ask whether it's worth it? Whether one person's work matters when the problems are so vast?"

*Trish smiles, that wild innocent smile.*

**Trish**: "I'll tell them what the river told me: You're already water. You're already flowing. The question isn't whether to be a river—you are one. The question is: What valley are you carving? What seeds are you carrying? What meadow will bloom because you passed through?"

**Glow**: "And I'll tell them what the mountains told me: The valley doesn't appear in one lifetime. But every stone moved, every glacier's patient grinding, every creek's persistent erosion—all of it matters. All of it shapes what ten thousand years from now, someone will call home."

*They sit in companionable silence as night settles. The stream keeps flowing. Stars wheel overhead. Somewhere, someone is starting to raise a sea.*

<a id="commander"></a>
## Commander's Intent: What to Do Right Now

*If you were a soldier receiving orders, you'd get two things: the specific task and the commander's intent—the deeper purpose that guides all decisions when plans change. Here's both.*

### The One-Hour Action

**Install Babashka and read one essay.**

Right now, today, you can:
1. Open your terminal
2. Type: `brew install babashka` (macOS) or your system's equivalent
3. Read this essay aloud to yourself or someone else
4. Notice which parts resonate, which parts challenge

**Why this matters**: Babashka is the scripting tool that makes complex automation simple. Reading aloud catches unclear prose. Both are foundation-building. You're not "preparing to start"—you're starting.

### The One-Day Action

**Find your local repair cafe. Identify your watershed.**

Within twenty-four hours, you can:
1. Search "repair cafe near me" or "tool library near me"
2. If none exist, note that—you just found a need to fill
3. Look at a topographic map and trace where your water goes
4. Walk to a stream, creek, or river and introduce yourself

**Why this matters**: Repair cafes are nodes in the network we're building. Watersheds are the natural boundaries of cooperation. You can't raise a sea without understanding where water flows. This is reconnaissance.

### The One-Month Action

**Start a garden. Contribute to an open-source project.**

Within thirty days, you can:
1. Plant something—in a pot, in a yard, in a community garden
2. Document what you planted, when, and what happened
3. Find an open-source project you use and read the contribution guide
4. Fix a typo, improve documentation, or report a clear bug

**Why this matters**: Gardens teach you to observe patterns. You learn that soil needs time, that plants teach patience, that failure instructs. Open source shows you how distributed collaboration actually works. Both are practice in patient accumulation.

### The One-Year Action

**Deploy one piece of infrastructure. Document it publicly.**

Within twelve months, you can:
1. Set up s six supervision for something you care about
2. Configure a Babashka task that automates repetitive work
3. Write down exactly how you did it
4. Share it—blog post, essay, GitHub repo, whatever fits

**Why this matters**: One year is enough time to learn a new skill deeply. Documentation is how knowledge spreads. By sharing your work, you become a teacher. The sea rises one documented deployment at a time.

### The Ten-Year Action

**Raise a sea. Train others to do the same.**

Within a decade, you can:
1. Build something that lasts—software, farm, community network
2. Teach ten people to build similar things
3. Document the method so a hundred more can learn
4. Hand it off and start something new

**Why this matters**: Ten years is long enough to fail, learn, rebuild, and succeed. Training others means your work multiplies. Handing it off means you trust the foundation. This is the rising sea method in action.

**The commander's intent behind all timeframes**: Build understanding that enables others. Patient work, freely shared, that outlives you.

## For the Martian Traveler

Dear Martian,

You've seen mountains on Earth. Maybe you have them on Mars too. Some mountains are geological—made of rock. Others are conceptual—made of complexity.

**Grothendieck teaches us**: Don't always climb. Sometimes, build a sea.

The Coldriver Tundra is a rising sea project:
- **Essays** accumulate like water filling valleys
- **Build scripts** create channels for flow
- **Git commits** are underground aquifers connecting everything
- **Grainstore** is the bedrock that holds the sea

**Century by century, the waters rise.**

One day, someone will look back and say: "How did they reach that peak?" And the answer will be: "They didn't climb. They raised the sea until the mountain became an island."

**The tundra is patient. And we are learning patience.**

## A Closing Meditation: On Receiving the Work

*Kneeling at the stream's edge. Cupping water in trembling hands.*

We did not make this water. It fell as rain—gift. It gathered in snowmelt—grace. It flows through stone channels carved over millennia—patience beyond our comprehension.

When we build foundations—mathematical, agricultural, technological—we imagine we are creating. But perhaps we are only *attending*. Noticing where the waters want to flow. Clearing channels. Removing obstacles. Waiting.

Grothendieck did not invent mathematics. He discovered it, the way Michelangelo said he discovered David waiting in the marble. The forms were always there—eternal, beautiful, true. He had the humility to serve them rather than claim them.

Atthowe does not create soil. She participates in its becoming. Plants and fungi and bacteria do the work. She tends. She witnesses. She steps back.

The Grainstore builders do not own software. They steward specifications. They preserve knowledge. They pass on seeds. The work continues after they're gone—as it should.

**This is the essence of the rising sea**:

You do not make the sea rise through force of will. You participate in its rising through patient attendance to what is already trying to emerge. You build foundations not because you are powerful, but because you are responsive to Beauty that calls through you.

David Bentley Hart writes: "All things are illuminated by the beauty of God." Perhaps all our building—when done with humility, with care for beings, with reverence for what outlasts us—is simply allowing that beauty to become visible. One channel at a time. One specification. One seed. One student taught to listen.

**Newman's prayer again**: *"Keep Thou my feet; I do not ask to see the distant scene; one step enough for me."*

We don't know if the Grainstore will work. If tundraOS will run on Framework laptops. If veganic agriculture will feed cities. If our children's children will thank us or curse us.

We know only the next step. The current clearing of the channel. The seed planted today. The student learning to code with compassion. The deer drinking unafraid.

**One step. Given in gift. Received in gratitude. Offered forward.**

The sea rises whether we notice or not. But when we participate with reverence, when we tend channels with care, when we build for beauty rather than glory—something changes. Not the outcome, perhaps. But us.

We become the kind of beings who can receive a world still worth inheriting. Who can look a deer in the eyes and feel kinship, not appetite. Who can touch a keyboard and think: *May what I build serve life.*

**This is enough. This is everything.**

*"The world is charged with the grandeur of God.  
It will flame out, like shining from shook foil."*

## Gratitudes

To Grothendieck, for showing us the rising sea.  
To Helen Atthowe, for teaching us living soil.  
To the Guardian Dragon, for reminding us: first, do no harm.  
To Trish and Glow, voices of the forest and mountain.  
To every builder who serves beauty rather than claiming it.  
To the deer at the stream, drinking in twilight, teaching us trust.

And to you, dear reader, for walking this path with patience.

**May your foundations be humble.**  
**May your seas rise with grace.**  
**May your work outlive you, serving those you will never meet.**

With snowflakes, waves, and seedlings.
