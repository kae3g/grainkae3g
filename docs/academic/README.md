## 🎓 Educational Value

### What Readers Learn
1. **Astronomical Approximations**
   - Solar house changes ~every 2 hours
   - Nakshatra changes ~every 13.3 hours
   - Ascendant changes faster at higher latitudes

2. **Offline-First Design**
   - Systems should work offline when possible
   - Conservative guesses better than no data
   - Deferred verification is acceptable

3. **grain6 Pattern**
   - Time-aware supervision
   - Automatic correction
   - Educational discrepancy logging

4. **Trust Through Transparency**
   - Show users what's happening
   - Explain limitations clearly
   - Verify and correct when possible

## 🌾 Philosophy Integration

### "The Grain Still Knows Time"
```
When clouds obscure the stars above,
The grain remembers - and the daemon waits.

Offline is not broken,
Just a different kind of time -
Conservative, yet wise.

        now == next + 1 🌾
```

### Core Principles Demonstrated
1. **Local Control, Global Intent**
   - Work offline (local control)
   - Verify when online (global intent)
   - User always informed of status

2. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Never crash (even without network)
   - Conservative guesses (better than nothing)
   - Clear warnings (transparency)

3. **Educational Transparency**
   - Show discrepancies when verified
   - Teach users about astronomical accuracy
   - Build trust through honesty

4. **Deferred Processing**
   - grain6 verification queue
   - Automatic correction when possible
   - Time-aware supervision pattern
